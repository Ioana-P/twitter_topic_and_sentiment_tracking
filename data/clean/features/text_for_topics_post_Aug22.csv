1889,1574124303540682752,Turtles 🐢  🐢 🐢 all the way down
2752,1580053413651705856,I see no indication whatsoever that Putin is willing to die and see Russia be consumed in fire I think he made a calculated bet about how he could expand the Russian empire in a nice quick easy war against what looked to be a failing state
2756,1580044118038052870,If you recall his speech in February  Putin threatened nuclear strikes if the West intervened in Ukraine Well that amounted to nothing Your way of approaching this results in giving Putin whatever he wants whenever he insists on it Theres no end
2757,1580043656014462976,Look ever since nuclear weapons became a problem we have been dealing with this dance North Korea India vs Pakistan etc So long as youre dealing with rational actors its not going to happen Im not worried about this Putin is bluffing just as he did in February
2758,1580042893636808705,Rewarding unprovoked aggression with a host of favorable concessions never goes well If you believe that Putin is the sort of guy who will launch nukes at our cities on a first strike basis wed never hit first then hes not a sane negotiating partner
2776,1580015239269355521,Quite right Giving in to nuclear blackmail is an invitation for a great deal more of it both from the power that got away with it and absolutely everyone else
2777,1580014572630847488,Havent thought through the consequences of that one have you
2791,1579958715809411073,What likely happened is that  talked to Putins lackeys and subsequently represented it to Bremmer that he talked to PutinRegardless he put out the Kremlin line and Russia praised him in return
2793,1579956552848781312,Also holy hell youre quoting Russell Brand Get better sources
2795,1579955122968592384,Remember when Putin kept claiming he had no intentions to invade Ukraine right up to the day he did Remember in 2014 when he said that the only annexation Russia wanted was Crimea
2796,1579954770244440064,Russias history of mendacity makes almost every other global government appear saintly
2797,1579954554497421312,Democrats dont reflect the will of the people Weird thing for the GOP to say after trying to overturn the result of the 2020 electionBeyond that  knows that Russia wont withdraw its troops and no fair election can be held while theyre there
2798,1579950546869706752,Innocent until proven guilty is a legal standard its not one to apply in our everyday lives to absolutely everyone and everythingSome people reveal themselves to be untrustworthy and were not obligated to assume good faith
2799,1579950125467979776,Do you have any idea how lame it is to quote someones selfeffacing joke right back at themIn any case Im right about this Musk proposed all concessions Ukraine needs to make Russia doesnt make any under his proposal None
2800,1579947186150051840,Why should we trust you on thisYour solution to the war was nothing but concessions to Putin
2813,1579914945915138049,To paraphrase what  is saying Sir I take offense at the idea I simply forwarded Putins demands on as my own plan Ill have you know I came up with that craven suggestion where the aggressor gets everything it wants all on my own
3093,1578121363964977152,Zelenskyy engaged in negotiations to end the war Putin had no interest in resolving the issue because his fundamental view as hes stated many times is Ukraine shouldnt exist as a separate nation It was never in Putins interest to resolve the issue He wanted war
3097,1578112645735104513,Im sure there are 2530 who want to leave Thats not sufficient to support annexation There are always elements of every country that wish they were in another country especially when a political party they dont like is in power
3125,1578059748825612289,The more nationalistic types like Poroshenko thought hed be a weak appeaser and they wanted a more confrontational stance However Zelenskyy was always openly proEU proNATO ascension and so on
3126,1578059171437625344,Yeah and he honored that He also ran on a proEU integration platform and a pledge to restore Ukraines territorial integrity
3148,1577851037238665217,If every country with distinct regional voting patterns should split up into each of those regions being its own country the whole damn world would dissolve
3149,1577850790034739201,The position of the Party of Regions wasnt for separatism and absorption by Russia but rather decentralization of the Ukrainian state to allow the different parts of the country to pursue their own local policies within the whole This is very different than separatism
3152,1577843642890440705,This is the 2019 parliamentary election Green is Zelenskyys party Dark blue is the proRussia but not separatist opposition Zelenskyy ran on a proEurope platform Notice how Kherson and Zaporizhzhia voted for Zelenskyys party
3385,1576998385499766789,Russia is currently losing on the battlefield Why should they be entitled to a peace deal that gives them all the upside and no punishment at all for starting this war
3386,1576997323665596418,Though it does raise this whole point about separatist movements Do you have these referenda just held again and again and again until the one time the separatists win for whatever reason and that sticks forever and ever
3387,1576996310158229510,why should a vote now be any more binding than the 1991 referendum which was held peacefully without troops coercing the result
3389,1576994715534495744,Never mind of course that  has outlined a potential peace thats all upside for Russia the country that started this war of conquest without any valid provocations to do so and its currently losing on the battlefield too It would be an insanely unjust peace
3601,1577837768914477056,Is Bitcoin a part of that

9231,1572100111995666440,Hmmm what is Optimus supposed to do by end of month
9233,1571696083180589058,How will lasers on Starlink satellites impact coverage and speed
9234,1570989463798681600,Great interview of  by  about SpaceXs crazy ambitious plans
9241,1566843529577615364,South Korea fertility rate in 2021 was 081  👀
9244,1565768948951416832,Also since when do global credit ratings agencies use a qualitative approach as their main approach to determine the credit rating for a company  Shouldnt they focus on the numbers  revenue margins cash flow profitability balance sheet demand growth etc
9245,1565768495467569152,Also doesnt make sense to rapidly expand product lineup with lowercost vehicles when already difficult to keep up with demand on current vehicles  This is common sense
9246,1565768073596084232,Moodys claim that Tesla is “not investment grade” is 🤯Even more ridiculous is them doubling down on junk credit rating claiming Tesla doesnt have enough vehicle models Fewer models  innovate more quickly on those models with more focus Intentional strategy by
10095,1578942388604530688,Make it so  This would be an INCREDIBLE video to see in high resolution from launch to landing 😍
10107,1578134685670117378,Sounds pretty catchy to me 😂 Fixing
10166,1575564577105846273,You do realize they literally use amphibious vehicles to go between Starbase and SPI today theyre working on a hovercraft shuttle service and they want as many people to be able to commute from SPI I really dont feel like a 500 gap of water is something horribly unrealistic
10167,1575562140626272256,Are you insinuating that amphibious cars are impossible That my friend is not rocket science 😂
10168,1575561494615293953,Ive literally been in the boring tunnels in Las Vegas how exactly dont they exist
10169,1575549300565692416,One of SpaceXs biggest problems is attracting talent to work at Starbase which is extremely remote South Padre is an awesome place to live but its almost an hour drive to Starbase despite being only 5 miles from Starbase because of the shipping channel
10170,1575548793084293121,Is this for real Thatll save those that go from SPI to Starbase soooo much time Ive got a CyberTruck reservation but would be happy with just a Boring tunnel between the two 😂
10182,1574481214559473665,Im not even talking about the FAA environmental review  or upcoming launch license Im just talking about the physical hardware for the launch pad  booster Not saying the FAA couldnt throw a wrench in the launch license at some point but so far they havet been the hold up
10183,1574480672961576992,Watch the video then respond if you honestly think they could have  can fly anything from the OLM prior to today They still cant physically do it today otherwise they would have Period
10184,1574479672846458881,They still dont actually have a full working GSE capable of supporting a test flight of just the booster Theyre close now finally but theres STILL things in the works necessary to support fully fueling firing up all 33 engines AND letting go of a booster
10185,1574478874120835072,broke this down perfectly There was ZERO chance a year ago they could have flown in a month Not even close Elon was wrong either intentionally or just unrealistically optimistic Watch this video  youll understand how far off they were
10199,1573917423362785280,I want that so bad SLC6 is the prettiest complex 🥺 but I fear Starship needs such a clean slate itd be more effort to transition SLC6 instead of just starting from scratch
10212,1573465845610709012,Amazing Dont forget both flaps will  should never be fully extended Having both control surfaces maxed out is not great for maintaining control
10215,1573387757854105601,Well as ambitious as it is its apparently realistic enough that NASA not only believes in it but is RELYING on it for their lunar lander Dont forget Falcon 1 was too ambitious then Falcon 9 then propulsive landing then reuse then reuse over and over etc etc
10216,1573385795087568896,Merlin is definitely sub mil Raptor is catching up to it and due to economies of scale will likely surpass it very soon DEFINITELY cheaper  to kN though already
10220,1573350422198292480,A year ago it was already under 1000000 and effort is being made to quarter that Not sure where theyre at but being cheaper than 750000 is in the realm of possibilities
10224,1573335077068611584,Thats not correct They are both up in the nose cone The Super Heavy booster has a header tank inside the main tank but not Starship
10225,1573334851637444609,Thats also not true Theyre still in the nose cone both of them are
10228,1573115049501405184,Ummmm not at all true There are definitely still header tanks
10266,1572051498019987456,Rocket engines and their nozzles are an hour glass shape The converging  diverging nozzle or delavel nozzle is exactly that But its not for the Venturi effect Its because once a gas is supersonic it speeds up with expansion not further restriction
10268,1571974587533107205,And then have the car react to speed limit changes quicker The car should slow down and be at the speed of a posted speed limit by the time it gets to the sign not two blocks later Same thing for user inputed speed changes Its really annoying
10272,1571922356473323527,New record How long before we see all 33
10317,1568021543493718016,What the new changes going on at the orbital pad Looks like were seeing some water deluge and systems to help keep things under control
12027,1574771594995838977,utterly convincing to a certain type of a smart person that is
12451,1577105773884166144,How many terminals How much  for eachAnd now Elon or Russia could potentially eavesdrop on all Ukrainian internet trafficYeah forgive me for not buying the superhero act
12452,1577085162579693570,When you spend your time lying its no surprise no one believes you anymore
13051,1579998555074625536,Why buy when he is the source Where else did the hair go after all those cuts by X
13053,1579997633078497280,How about calling regular summon dumb summon current version is called “not smart summon” and nextgen being…Pause for effectSmart Summon…
13055,1579969251498393600,Except in that meme there is no Florida Or Hawaii or the thousands of islands throughout the world 😏
13056,1579964403126272005,And what did world peas cost humanity Hawaii😢 and Florida🫤 Good thing SpaceX is building up Boca ChicaStarbase
13065,1579614751319265281,And button doesnt have a fixed place So depending upon how screen is displayed will dictate where the button ends up 🤦🏼
13071,1579297126315876353,how will Cybertruck fare in similar towing range test “If a truck towing 3500 pounds cant even go 100 miles … that is ridiculously stupid This truck cant do normal truck things…”
13072,1579223335720091648,I originally thought with metal fatigue but both carbon fiber and aluminum dont have a known fatigue limit So perhaps with the refurbishmentturnaround maintenance it can be flown indefinitely
13089,1577838671289630723,People cant believe you are still talking but yet here you are Shouldnt you be in a nursing home or psychiatric ward for this almost stalkerlike obsession Its not healthy
13091,1577748164794368008,Since Ill be taking my  with me on my business trip I set my family up with a local ISP while Im gone And how I dont miss the days of having a tech come out because some wall plug or coax hardware isnt working   you spoiled me with simplistic internet
13095,1577549913692545025,Depends If a camera can measure photons through 1” foam or through a torrential downpour then sure for a shrub Solid Wood fence Not even radar can  those cameras are reacting to individual photons that are returned from a every 56 picosecond laser 0000000000056 seconds
13096,1577544494710493185,Like any computer hardware system newer systems can provide bettermore functionality having more energy efficiency etc
13097,1577544244729942017,Well on Tesla Autonomy Day 2019 it was stated that hw4 next generation chip was already half way into production 4year production cycle and would be ready in 2 years 2021 and would be about 3x better than HW3 current system
13099,1577532925184204802,Well from a technical standpoint cameras measuring individual photon counts vs making images looking pretty to human eye can see through torrential downpours foam pad that is 1” thick fog dust etc and wouldnt need radar
13101,1577528053089112066,For me it has been system crashes in Cali and on 69x all versions to public beta testers it actually states that it was a system error which took a full deep sleep cycle to correct Some symptoms can include lagging visualizations on at least two occasions
13105,1577511776018698240,If FSD Computer was more reliable redundancy wouldnt be an issue But I have documented cases even on 6922 of FSD having full on system error crash It takes 5min to boot back up Or car going to deep sleep to fix In CA it was predictablelocalized TX not so much
13125,1577141567047237632,Planner5d does this as well
13127,1577140283594399747,Math is a tad bit off there guy Would be more of 3133USD To give everyone798bil 1 bil musk would need 7980000000000000000 7 quintrillion 980 quadrillion dollars Global currency comes in at about 5 quadrillion Falling a lil short by 7975000000000
13128,1577136906168508418,Oh Im already crazy
13129,1577132190940336128,You forgot usable mapnav system the improves fsd beta not hinders it
13130,1577130549814398976,Actually it is from 1sthand experiences  accounts that I have seen the ugly nature of humanity A daughter hanging out with a friend whose father is a pedophile The slain soldiers in fort hood by fellow soldiers A soldier murdered by her loving husband on my street
13133,1577085069667143680,Speaking of amazing backtobacktoback  launches Starlink Crew5 AND Galaxy 33 34 Thats ludicrous Cant wait to watch them all via Starlink
13134,1577042148905857024,Yup Only way to solve the problems with humans is to get rid of all the humans Until humanity evolves human nature will always be the source of conflict
13139,1576564541307047937,Based on the presentation of OptimusAI its capabilities and future how do you feel the Milken Institute Asia Summit panel see the future of AI development and implementation
13149,1576323358924636160,I actually lost weight on my  cruise Even with drink package windjammer and main dining room dining etc
13150,1576322685063561216,Whats your daily macro setup look like
13152,1576226865177427968,Just imagine then how small a cerebrum Mr Jim Bob Duggars from “19 kids  and counting” is
13153,1576034123176517637,Plus the actual manufacturing of the head and body features
13154,1576033971137236992,They likely had to go through alpha stages to find the right hardware and get the software and hardware working right And several revisions of the actuators picking right battery pack that optimizes functionality vs massweight
13156,1575652580834783232,How much do we honestly expect the lamestream media aka socalled “journalists” to understand what is said at AI Day wo googling every other word
13157,1575597323639435264,Yup he even took time to say hello to me
13158,1575550092873826304,Different question same answer
13161,1575334364174491649,Oh how Id love to have Dishy on the roof again F onpost housing and their 🐂💩 satellite addendum  Especially their reasoning
13164,1574965238796931073,Can Tesla improve frequency of map database releases Its a huge crutchbottleneck in areas that arent overfitted like SF
13165,1574962267048751105,LikewiseHeres where the simulation really comes to play Of all the Tesla events that I tried to get invited to Plaid Day was the only one that I could attend Without pulling off some crazy magic act
13170,1574891911311130624,Ive owned my model 3 for almost 4 years and have lived in areas where summers exceed 115 almost daily Guess Ive been fortunate that only MX has been 12v battery drv door handle and window actuator replacements Last place I lived got a lil toasty during the summer
13171,1574867445738774539,On a side note itd be nice if Im listening to a streaming app like  on iphone and then get into the car itd do an appleesque handover and continue playing incar from same moment
13172,1574604255910060033,Oh what to do with Starlink when landlord not only prohibits satellites to be installed anywhere on the house exterior but they prohibit a ground mount not already present in the property lines And mowingweed trimming is mandated so best to not keep Dishy on the ground
13188,1574010386222878721,And that a huge chunk of voice recordings from the 1st and 3rd movies ended up getting cut Like enough material to make a future sequel without having to actually bring in Robin Williams So Williams had it put in his will the aforementioned clause
13189,1574009774991106048,Part of the problem was RW told Disney that hed do the part for so little money 75k USD as long as they didnt use his voice used for any marketing campaigns Disney broke that trust when it created several commercials and Genie merchandise
13190,1574004039011934208,Thats because of the fallout that happened between Robin Williams and Disney Robin Williams disagreed with Disneys business practices So he had it put into his will that Disney could not use his name taped performances and voice recordings for 25 years after his death 2039
13201,1573546355766730755,Which means he can be held accountable
13205,1573539366554812416,Least we would control the op tempo Wait until they decide we are doing it too slow and start doing it themselves
13206,1573538947027845121,He also said free long distance supercharging for Model 3… and nav system would be light years ahead… hahahahaha Also said WiFi garage opener was coming soon as well as a drivethru mode pothole detection volume slider for joe mode enlarge side cameras when backing up…
13207,1573534347071733760,Elon says a lot of things but rarely do things come to fruition if ever
13210,1572325434863263746,Quite a few have a test loop that they use as a control to determine if areas it does well do the same as well as areas where prior versions have struggled or flat out failed
13215,1572281463441354753,Itd be interesting to jump that much Id expect maybe 202224 But I guess it is possible especially if Tesla is trying to catch beta up to prod build releases
13216,1572281069856239618,103 was quite the fiasco It was same branch just different point release 20213651 1031 from 20213652 103Those rollbacks are a little bit easier than a different release branch Like someone on 202228x going back to 20222017 106922
13220,1572073897604030464,Unfortunately Ive seen no improvement in 6922 from prior versions through one of the first iterations of beta in this regard Even with all these rewrites of the code
13229,1571975437789679616,My work route is 90 straight road and still drives down the center of it Keep tugging wheel to the right which fixes it for about 18th of a mile before going back to center Disengaged every time after that for every occasion on 1222 through 6922
13230,1571973880432005120,Yup Leaving my neighborhood and the road leading to my work Doesnt help either that the same work roadroute is horrible with Tesla nav system
13231,1571969495887147014,For being a professor of economics your math blows worse than a pornstar on pornhub
13232,1571968145656537090,Can beta Dev team work to prevent beta from driving down center of unmarked road despite it being a 2way road Lots of unnecessary disengagements from that
13233,1571939261439672321,This could also work on a smaller scale
13241,1571339684982456325,That and its 5050 for the dashcam viewer to actually load Even the vehicle settings menu works maybe half of the time
13242,1571339150984372225,Is that Teslas stance on the navigation  routing system Or can perhaps the company can actually put out a 21st century nav system that goes with the vehicles and tech
13246,1571139179643572225,How did he lie Just because some services are using it suddenly makes is not peaceful Would you rather service members in Europe or in remote areas not be able to talk to their family and loved ones
13247,1571008756443648000,Flawless Far from it Ive had to disable auto lane change because of the flaws Id prefer beta on highway having actually experienced fsd beta on a highway albeit brief period of time
13250,1570992860237017088,This guy in the back is wondering hmm is that Elon musk Maybe I should ask about AI Day 2022 Or FSD beta v11
13251,1570988556067434496,I get it on occasion on 692
13260,1570980520498200576,Starlink is a USBased ISP and must follow the rules as FCC and similar govt bodies have outlinedruled as in they are regulated
13261,1570980164804448257,Apparently  bots and the alike have really dropped in sophisticated means gotten dumber 🤦🏼
13263,1570978886946783237,Apparently not Reddit user was contacted about it despite using VPN with their starlink
13280,1570961841370853376,They have already bought it
13281,1570961736630669315,Military is already in process of using starlink
13283,1570957640653742080,Can ookla Speedtest test not only my internet to router speed but also phone to router speed Thats news to me
13286,1570954270434021377,Any chance for a NEW NEW app fix for speed test Going from JSON Parse error to an update that still makes it useable isnt a “fix” like release notes state
13287,1570953731285590017,Starlink probably has ability to see traffic that goes to unscrupulous websites and such They already called out users behind VPN for seeding House of the Dragon per Reddit
13292,1570948384885964800,Thats assuming he even wear big boy pants Considering how he lacks any real spine wouldnt surprise me if Jill wore the real pants in that family
13296,1570940731925368832,HD maps isnt the solution its the updated map data that is updated regularly
13297,1570940405616881667,Nope You could increase hardware to 32 sensors and it wouldnt do it yet Still needs the data and training
13299,1570925716308656129,typically when an app update says something fixing issue with speed test it actually fixes it This is not considered fixed
13301,1570863641876123648,Starts with a T Ends with an A ESL in the middleelon musk
13304,1570857374260535296,I showed a gate guard fsd beta and what it renders In an impressed manner Hes like damn SGT Sergeant And as I was waved through he said damn nice car oh and have a nice day
13305,1570856381938561024,How about functional routes and accurate routing first
13306,1570855924138659840,Is it as a whole drop or just because of TOU CA supercharging in LA area is around 28¢kw but 2x during extended peakhours Which makes no sense as PGE and SCE peak times are 49PM but TSLA charges peak rates from 11am9pm or around those times But 🍎 valley is flat 43¢kw🤔

21632,1569598307147681793,Its tough to say Im still waiting for the neural nets and AI to start crushing it The problem with the model right now at least in my opinion is the unpredictable human drivers and the also unpredictable construction
21634,1569450702656905216,Based on my experience the chance of getting in an automobile accident is significantly lower while using s Full SelfDriving Beta  than while not using it
21635,1569437509557571584,And it makes you a safer driver because you pay attention more and are forced to not be bored

27430,1579890036941918209,When closure for lifting

27435,1578393644528275458,Dont know why But I have a feeling that we might see full stack starship today or tomorrow
27443,1578075575239024640,Hi Elon  😀 According to  380 tankers delivered to Starbase So I would be really happy to know Will B7 performs a long duration full stack 33 engines static fire Thanks🙏😀
27444,1578071008979947521,Thats amazingI think there is 1 photo that will be more interesting than this Starlink camera captures Ships reentry or deorbit
27445,1578021542440890372,Everything is getting ready for Orbital flight test
27446,1577958230520729601,SPMT moved to Mega bay for B7 rollout  But this time the rollout is different According to  Full stack Starship will perform a wet dress rehearsal and a full stack 33 engines static fire and if everything goes well we might see a launch in November

27459,1575862041134665733,Hi  Can you please give us some information  about the plans for Ship 24 in upcoming weeks My opinion is that it will go back to production site for its final preparationsThanks Elon🙏😊
27460,1575859607293263877,Maybe it will go back to production site for its final preparations
27461,1575532465816739840,Yep Im a python AI dev
27462,1575518628862042112,As an AI programmer 😀 This event is one of the most interesting things for me❤️😍
27465,1574832453738532868,Hi Elon😀 I have a question about the Mechazilla system in 39A As we saw in the photos The arms for 39A is shorter than arms for Starbase Does it means that we wont see a catch from 39A and spacex will make another mechazilla to catch the booster in another padThanks🙏😊
27466,1574789955678765056,Actually one of the most interesting things in this image is that the entry burn from this angle really looks like a Meteor 😀Image
27467,1574787900939583490,Elon had a dream to make rockets reusable He done it… He has a dream to go to Mars He will do it… Always chase your dreams💪
27468,1574147772110016512,Hello Elon 😀 I would be happy to know Which Ship and Booster will launch first batch of Starlink satellites
27469,1574014746508115974,Falcon 9 launches never gets old 😀 Cant wait to see Starship launches Starlink v2 satellites 😀
27470,1573431180489527296,Booster 8 is quite the same as Booster 7 and as  said Booster 9 had a lot of upgrades I think one of them that weve seen is the new method of section stacking for Booster 9  will Booster 8 launch with Ship 25
27472,1573247107770847234,How long will it take for Booster 9 to be flight ready
27473,1573234515728019456,Finally the PEZ dispenser is completely closed which means nothing will launch with s24 on the first orbital flight test
27474,1573067754030211076,Ship 26  27s nosecone section has been moved to low bay As you can see in this image the section doesnt have any TPS tiles The reason might be that they will temporarily launch the second stage without recovering them
27475,1572955322465255424,will ship 24 carry statlink v2 on its first orbital flight test
27477,1572949591464546307,So everything is getting ready for 33 engines static fire😀
27478,1572621855709601794,B7 is going back to the high bay for it final preparations before launch😀
27479,1572577317574283265,Thanks for sharing these great informations 😍😍🙏
27480,1572562946387218438,Hi Elon Can you please give us some updates about orbital flight date I cant wait to see this launch 😀
27481,1572392731015806976,Wow How much did spacex had progress on raptor 3
27482,1572026969927327745,The animation is interesting Cannot imagine how much the real life ignition of these things will be exciting and inspiring For sure Starship is one of the most inspiring things in the world
27483,1572025777411227648,This is the power of only 7 engines Can you imagine the power of 33 engines 😳 It is 100 percent that the power of 33 raptors will be more than what they showed in the last animation Cant wait to see the 33 engine testVideo
27486,1571939158930636801,How long before we see launch😀
27487,1571938262780116997,And when spacex is aiming for launch
27488,1571938075491565570,And great to make grassfire 😅
27489,1571933598885748738,With these successes What is the aim for the launch
27490,1571917132337745933,Cant wait to see that😀Will you try to have a static fire with a gimbal test
27491,1571570418150146048,Is spacex planning to temporarily remove the flaps and TPS to launch Starlink V2 faster
27492,1571204509598097408,Actually We should Thank Elon
27496,1569290630723158017,Hi   I have a question about next Starships Does spacex want to remove the TPS tiles and flaps on Ship and temporarily ignore second stage reusability I mean something like this
27497,1568643769351929862,Yes I totally agree Next will they might just go for a wet dress rehearsal
27498,1568643606335918081,I think they can do it in one or two weeks
27499,1568639461063540736,If last B7 spin prime test was with all 33 engines Maybe mow Spacex wants to perform a full stack static fire with all 33 engines

27877,1578113371492294658,Guess it is but Elon has his own reasoning so let the man explain what exactly he means After all he did find the 2012 electoral map somewhere
27879,1578109489139617820,Its unclear what exactly he means by WWIII The Russian troops are a bunch of bums whose knowledge of warfare boils down to bombing and torture Were they to attack a NATO theyd be done in a split secondAs for nuclear stuff well other countries have nuclear weap too

33005,1575888679213465609,btw  how is 4680 battery production going Is the ramp up going as planned Which would mean youll have a 10 GWh production end of 2022 if I remember correctly what you said at Battery Day

33203,1578203312180334593,I dont know him personally but his bio shows he is an expert in this field Not all experts have political agenda or a bias against any business
33206,1578173635411709954,So what really matters is its governance mechanism and its transparency I have reasonable faith in IFRS governance IFRSISSB are going through public comments and local jurisdictions verification So unlike rating agency they are more publicly accessed and monitored
33207,1578172802481655808,IFRS would certainly welcome Tesla or other Americans as a donor it seems odd that businesses are financially involved in standard setting or regulatory body but such practice is not uncommon A few know FRBs are owned by its member commercial banks not  by Federal govment
33209,1578139816260423681,Issb is not a scam Its a very highly expected disclosure standard setting work by IFRS International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS is well established and adopted by many European and Asian countries including Japan while US always cares for their own standard or SEC
33224,1576121798428856320,How amazing   team pulled this together within a year

35343,1578900774331240448,I do a calendar every year There will be one this year Ill eventually do a book and Im in the very early stages of planning one but I think I have some more special stuff Id like to capture one day before I publish it
35350,1578167297138577408,Would this abort have been triggered during a Starlink flight or are those sorts of parameters set differently
35405,1575514253393543172,What kind of tires did you get and any quantifiable difference in range or handling
35406,1575508726768967680,When are you looking at first deliveries to customers
35407,1575506436624470016,is it normal to see a 35 week wait for  Service for a simple four tires purchase  install for a Model 3 Seems like a huge backlog of service
35448,1571967734115868672,Loving FSD Beta — but — could the vehicle initiate the turn signal before switching into the turn lane It uses the signal for speedbased lane changes but not for merging into a turn lane
35455,1570615677106671616,It does this if making a speedbased lane change but when merging into a turn lane I find that the turn signal is not engaged until after the merge and the vehicle is already squarely in the turn lane
35456,1570549907295211520,I want the car to initiate the turn signal before committing to changing lanes into a turn lane Really not that hard
35457,1570522818839990272,Any chance turn signals can be initiated by FSD before the actual merge into a turn lane Feels weird and a bit unsafe to not signal intent to other drivers until well after we get into the turn lane
35468,1570093986295037957,Also one of the most frustrating things for me but perhaps disproportionately compared to wrong decisionmaking is the lack of turn signal when getting into a turn lane but instead waiting until Im squarely in the turn lane to initiate the signal
35469,1570086118648946690,Im finding 10692 to drive smoother more humanesque in its operation but it more frequently makes decisionbased mistakes in regards to lane changes missing turns and speed changes Central Florida
35476,1569530563173969920,Already did — no reply
35478,1569419412112818180,Yeah have rebooted a few times to no avail
35479,1569417720571088908,Are long download times normal for new FSD build Been stuck for five hours at 48
35489,1568267475971723269,Yes really need Supercharging somewhere near KSCCape Port Canaveral or somewhere in northern Merritt Island would be ideal
35501,1566857535834963975,Do you aim to reset FSD Beta strikes with the impending 1069 release to wider fleet
35971,1570101401321078784,Haha I guess Its getting to the point where I might just tell them to schedule the appointment when the parts get here
35972,1570100067633176578,Alright this is ridiculous This will make it a MONTH since my original appointment 😤
35980,1567627504717893632,Technically its more like 5 weeks because this was a follow up appointment to one that also took two weeks to schedule lol
36095,1578400235344347143,Sunrise over Giga Texas on this 7 October 2022 morning Gorgeous
36098,1578051754041741312,Hoping this works for you Not long after my camera was replaced with the correct one I downloaded Beta
36099,1578005633676283909,That is the plan
36101,1577742136396611584,Giga Texas Cyber Berms lit up today Heres a SHORT video to show how this looks and hints at how the entire factory will look once all the lighting is completed See this  more in 4K in my main YouTube video a bit later today
36104,1577715767377891357,I cant wait to show you those images someday
36113,1576950689800294401,More images from a busy  beautiful 3 October 2022 morning at Giga Texas Progress at electrical substation  cathode plant changes on the S end  E side reconfiguration continues See more in my YouTube video later today
36121,1575675202565857280,Its a bit of a mystery but thats part of the fun trying to figure it out from what I can see at the site There have been hints on Twitter and news channels of a tunnel from Giga Texas to downtown and the airport
36122,1575662345501569024,What is interesting is the straight line this makes from the Giga Texas proposed Boring Tunnel to the “island” all the way to the Boring Company address in Bastrop and also almost to the Texas Capitol building in downtown Austin Hmmmmm
36123,1575654951442710528,Interesting idea … Im hoping to get a few more clues at the site soon
36132,1574854084015886336,Hoping you will get it soon as well
36133,1574848735858855944,Came out via mobile service and replaced a single camera
36134,1574845051330502659,Model S is now uploading FSDBeta I appreciate the support Tesla has provided and hoping more will also get their “legacy” FSDcapable cars updated soon as well
36135,1574816012293267456,One B pillar camera that was part of the replacement in Feb 2022 seems to be the wrong part number Now trying to code the car to see if the “FSD Teams “system” can now “see” my car
36136,1574807503673720832,FYSA my Model S is currently being evaluated by Tesla to figure out what is the issue preventing it from being updated to FSDBeta They think there is a hardware issue with a part they replaced in Feb 2022 that is causing the issue 🤞
36142,1574424462057000963,Perhaps after everyone who bought it but still doesnt have it gets the upgraded
36146,1574004936941223937,It was fixed at the same time … the technician who installed the cameras broke the connector
36147,1573814113498800128,Hope you can get Beta soon🤞
36150,1573419084603359232,Not me Lived in North Dakota and that was enough of the cold for me Texas is more my temperature range
36151,1573417725539541004,706 in the past 30 days per the App Thats more than enough
36152,1573417373490724865,Youre welcome Alex Its been an amazing journey and Im glad to be able to share with everyone what I see
36158,1573141972562640898,I got MCU2 upgrade in July 2020
36159,1573106538717351937,Its not the software stack I was later contacted by Tesla today and they think one of my new cameras they installed is having a polling issue but I dont have any warnings or issues They scheduled an appointment next week to investigate further
36160,1573065569582063616,Hope we both will get it It does seem like Model 3 and Ys get the priority
36161,1573064372326666241,Thanks and it has been Tesla has now reached out and will be trying to figure out if one of the new cameras isnt polling correctly even though I have no warnings and nonBeta FSD works just fine
36165,1573040144768438272,Hope you get it soon I also hope my experience can help people like you in similar circumstances Good luck
36166,1573036486563434498,If your car was built before August 2017 then you need it I wish the car did a configuration check when selecting the FSD Beta request button to tell you but it doesnt
36167,1573035704728313856,You can see the number of miles driven in the App safety score section top right “i” button
36168,1573033669807292418,I have 706 miles driven in the past 30 days BTW so that isnt the issue
36169,1573032896037888001,One of the cameras they upgraded seems to have an issue although I have no indications of this and the nonBeta GSD works correctly They have set a service appointment next week to try and fix it and recode my car so Teslas system can “see” my car for Beta upgrade 🤞🤞
36170,1573031666435620864,Wow Im in a poll Cool
36171,1573031217699725317,Ive since been contacted by Tesla an hour ago and there  is an issue with how one of my cars replacement camera that they replaced as part of the upgrade program operates and reports its status to Tesla They set an appointment to fix next week There are no warning lights
36176,1572991502573264896,Ok … I think you wouldve lost the bet Elon responded but inaccurately stating I needed new cameras but I already had this done Tesla service just reached out … they are looking into why my car is coded incorrectly I never would have got FSD Beta had I not tweeted
36177,1572988372338999297,You mean since February 2022 Yes my car has been powered off and at the Service center several times since my cameras were upgraded in Feb 2022
36178,1572988130306711555,Hope highlighting this issue helps you and many others
36179,1572986914633912320,Im pretty sure Ive got a good handle on what is needed as Ive been chasing this rabbit since Oct 2021 when the issue with cameras was first highlighted Its why I got it so quickly Since then Ive verified with Tesla Service several times since then my car meets requirements
36180,1572986232635891716,Ive been told multiple times since then my car has everything it needs for FSD but be patient
36181,1572985759405154304,I already had the upgraded cameras installed by Tesla for free for this reason in Feb 2022
36182,1572985439937593344,Already got them in Feb 2022
36183,1572985335629455361,They already upgraded my cameras for free as part of this program for FSD Beta in Feb 2022
36184,1572985073812504581,However he has bad info My car was already upgraded by Tesla for free in Feb 2022 for this reason
36185,1572984671247691777,Ive already had the upgraded cameras in Feb 2022
36186,1572983413765799938,I do not … had this done in February 2022
36187,1572983128607563776,Except … my car already had this free upgrade by Tesla for this exact reason in February 2022
36188,1572982754555338754,Feb 2017 build Model S
36189,1572982673961803776,Elon simply is getting bad information I want Tesla to succeed and improve and this shows an example of internal processes from customer contact to internal processing that needs fixing This is why Im highlighting it
36190,1572982042530402306,I already had this upgrade by Tesla for free in February 2022
36191,1572981896526843909,I already had my cameras upgraded by Tesla for free as part of this necessary upgrade in February 2022
36192,1572978319724843010,This was part of the free replacement program
36193,1572978009769971713,I got my cameras replaced by Tesla in February 2022
36195,1572950056868741126,That has been my path as well Cameras upgraded in February
36197,1572946338110738432,Did that in February Next
36198,1572944454675226625,There are many components associated with FSD 🤓
36199,1572943226809765889,Ill bookmark this tweet and check back at the end of the year or sooner to see if you are correct
36200,1572941661600186369,How many years should I be patient Or if another 6 months go by will you say I should have said something sooner Catch22 logic
36201,1572941307273682945,To be clear Im highlighting this to hopefully help Tesla improve customer service and also help their service personnel put into a difficult situation unnecessarily as they need a better process
36202,1572937198923563008,The avenue for customer service on this issue is not a good one Im trying to also highlight this fact so Tesla can get better
36203,1572936609120632835,I think this more than meets the requirement
36204,1572934914642948098,Ive been told this exact same thing for most of 2022
36205,1572932943445622784,This is Teslas “reply” just minutes after asking for help today Frustrating but I wonder how many others are getting the same response days after “everyone with safety score over 80 gets it” This is 22 September 2022
36262,1568267702954754048,I took the photo a few hours ago
36284,1566066394231447557,Often referred to as the stamping extension area
36285,1566066202790821889,This is a new location adjacent to the original isolation foundations in the stamping machine structure
36288,1565888565195771904,They are building an isolation foundation in the eastern half for a large metal forming machine to support CT production
36786,1579936619075080193,Have you tried it
36789,1579241108932300800,Whats your fondest memory from the early days with tesla Elon
36797,1578605361845915649,Will we ever be able to travel at the speed of light
36798,1578590711880241153,Is AI a winner takes all situation
36803,1578564911676129282,I swear to god twitter shadow banned Elon wtf
36804,1578564399517900801,wen dojo as a service c
36806,1578436251689943040,Seems like twitter has shadow blocked Elon 🤔
36809,1578412563712417792,Will you consider adding a starlink feature for Teslas in the future Elon
36810,1578408918476275712,Elon the cybertruck will be the best selling pickup truck in history will you please make a cyber sedan at some point thatd be really epic I think itd be a great succes
36811,1578407714388119555,Elon I think you need to start thinking about releasing a cheaper model EV next year is going to be tough due to the recession
36818,1578148002035703810,Joe Biden giving Joe Biden a medal for bringing gas prices down is even funnier did you ever have a one to one with the old man Elon
36821,1578065683413438466,cheers Elon 🥂 TSLA is now finally investment grade
36822,1578058005354086400,Have you ever spoken to Xi Jinping in person Elon
36829,1577890568151121920,will you spin twitter off as a public company later on
36831,1577883840630194178,What is Putin like in person
36833,1577881518088884226,Have you ever talked to Putin in person Elon
36834,1577861941875380224,Im so astounded by the fact that most people would rather see nuclear war than to have peace truly horrifying
36873,1574918583884419072,Kevin you went allin mid august
36924,1572748174514860032,Elon in the 80s Volcker raised rates to 20 and the SP500 dumped a maximum of 28Unemployment doubled recession ensued28 max downturn Crazy right
36968,1569836630365671429,Elon how will Tesla grow 50 in a recessionIs that even possible
37013,1566240951953227778,I wonder if a century from now our rockets of today will look like horses to cars lol 🥲
37591,1580574016913301505,Interesting tweet to respond to  Sounds good to me
37593,1579795175081095168,any hints as to what branch this weeks  update will be on  Lots of hopeful new beta users that are ahead of the current 202220 branch hoping to be eligible for the next version
37594,1579631579256983552,Thank you for that
37595,1579613567179198465,I think speed bumps switched to occupancy maps and have degraded a bit  Will get better but needs time
37596,1579608150311055360,VIN would be equivalent to the Tesla username unless you own multiple Teslas on one account  so there is that
37597,1579607114519281664,I have begged to the highest levels for this kind of information  It seems to be a struggle to manage customer testing with such information and detail  It might be a defensive strategy to mitigate unforeseen expectations or consequences
37598,1579605373442744320,Thanks for the confirmation Shoaib
37599,1579604423130566656,Well  from the engineers last week  The mothership captures the disengagement  but the data going to the team to focus on is different  If you want to highlight it to the team  The snapshot is better
37600,1579569302294102016,Snapshot button 57 snapshots max per drive before data gets overwritten with new dataEmail fsdbetacomWith email add as much metadata to the email as possible so that any details could be looked up Date time location issue Tesla username etc
37601,1579528740606218240,You could watch the line go blue  but while driving that is not a safe way to know  You really just have to feel the commit acceleration  In post production you can look at my CAN bus data to see actual torque being applied or when the path turns dark blue
37602,1579494197127938049,This should be easy to tweak with software and in the past various acceleration jerk profiles have been used  I feel that in an effort to smooth out the ride some acceleration was removed that is needed situationally
37603,1579491822141075457,Thank you Earl  I appreciate the thoughts
37604,1579489905281224704,Hey Twitter Im back out testing  v106923  Unprotected Left Turns in Light Fog  It did pretty good today one disengagement  Here is a clip check it out   Full length video
37606,1579113479445041154,Saw it last week  Here is the picture I took of it
37607,1579094827446448135,Freedom to communicate is the great equalizer across populations  Your contributions with Starlink are significant
37608,1578392609470484480,Saw it once in personat Palo Alto several times since  Not up to ten yet
37609,1578390724684484610,We will be dissecting and rewatching the  video until   So much information that needs digesting
37611,1577722208067141632,I really appreciate the heartfelt thoughts Amazing community of support is unmatched My engagement during small down moments is also a bit of a therapy  Thank you again
37612,1577716894869721101,Love it and cant wait  Initial feedback from v106923 is a good improvement for just a bug fix  Iteration is king Wen
37613,1577668871984652288,At least as sure as they were in 2020
37614,1577667315637837826,See you there Yes it will be good to see you again
37615,1577666233830342657,Ok I actually should by John a coffee for that callout  Nice one
37616,1577665420890456064,There is that word zero again
37617,1577663894536978436,They are not in the position to finalize anything for   This is a journey we are on FSD will continue to evolve with NN technologies from both academia and AI technology leaders like  HW4 is an important step but not the last  is probably in the works
37618,1577659815849066498,No engineer ever uses absolutes like 0 or 100
37619,1577653265692606464,I think this is just another bug fix on the 202220 branch  Iteration  No new features
37621,1577638555089862658,1  20222018 was installed on my car last night This is version v106923 and NOT the version anticipated based on  tweet a few weeks ago I am at a funeral for my sister this week and will be unable to test it  It is a bug fix with no new notes
37622,1577501616705785856,Its not a static optimization from here forward  They are still inventing new NN for    is excited about NeRFs  Its all changing and if we do get more resolution that will need  more compute even if optimized Its a journey jump onboard
37623,1577496946234859520,Sorry Me  Dont see us removing the driver in HW3  Love what it will bring to the Tesla community with future city streets ADAS capabilities It is still amazing
37626,1577489043818180609,I yelled  ITS WALKING Not sure if it came across on the live stream but in the front row it was impressive the risk that they took with that demo
37627,1577488520423567360,Glad to hear and be part of your story
37628,1577485641209634816,thinks that  is the mitigation to my BPillar inferior camera argument  Interesting thought I dont think this is the plan but it was fun driving with him and his son Ryan after they picked me up from the airport ahead of
37629,1577482180506578944,was right I was wrong  The  walked on the stage This was part of a long convo with Robert and his son Ryan after they picked me up at the airport ahead of
37630,1577481089072758784,and I discussing hard  corner cases  Loved the drive and the convo  Hope you do too
37631,1577430251684364288,Do it  Lets go change can be good  The turmoil was painful
37634,1577274887198363649,The Low Carb lifestyle should not be oversimplified to stacks of meat and cheese  Its simply is the elimination of foods that are high in carbohydrates including sugars both natural and processed  There are many vegetables included and required in this style of living
37635,1577106223102496768,I am so glad to be a part of your story
37636,1576302950775132160,It will Go over cellular but very slowly  WiFi is for speed
37637,1576292963134877696,Its a dynamic number but in the single digits  Basically each snapshot can use up different amounts of memory and when the allocated memory is used by 57 snapshots the oldest one gets over written
37638,1576291302626324480,Official no but I talked to engineers yesterday  So you have good second hand info now
37639,1576277575541719040,It has everything they need  And if they want more data  the snapshot will tell them when and were to go get it
37640,1576271427488997376,I also noticed that the presentation was split into three separate segments with separate skill sets  The guys that were into robots may have lost interest in FSD  just explaining there was so much detail it would be hard to stay engaged if it was not in your area
37641,1576270154245120004,I can also see similar data with my Google Access Point but my Netgear Orbi does not show this  So I have a dedicated Google AP just for the Tesla
37643,1576261556760764416,No change in my thesis
37644,1576256288975048704,I heard this message loud and clear even to the extent of turning Sentry mode on at home to keep the car from sleeping
37645,1576255301241561091,Not making excuses because the volume was distracting during the QA But because I was in the room you could see there were dozens of stations with recruiters talking to the talent on different subjects  I truly believe that chatter was serious specific recruiting going on
37646,1576253995173433344,That would be for the team to know and for us to speculate
37647,1576251376862056448,They get collected but in a much bigger pot of data that takes a bit more work to extract  But its there for them to access if needed on certain issues  I got the sense the snapshot would get their attention better
37648,1576250655684972544,said that the Tesla AI team might start a podcast to keep the information flowing  I cant overstate how huge this would be to tighten up the feedback loop  💯 if there was a way to submit questions  If you want to have an occasional guest I volunteer
37649,1576244825023606787,Thank you AJ for sitting down and having lunch with me and driving around it was great to get to know your story  See you at TeslaConFL soon
37650,1576238085959929856,Regulators is my guess  But no specifics
37651,1576237890362740736,I unfortunately didnt ask this specific question  My mistake
37652,1576237552410845185,Next month is what he said which is October based on when he said it but maybe we should just interpret that as 45 weeks
37653,1576233354625630208,‘s excitement about NeRFs was really fun to see
37655,1576231878171820032,I learned that the transition to occupancy network should be taking over the older speed bump code  It sounds like the evolution of the occupancy network will continue to be tweaked to more accurately slow down for speed bumps and all other road features
37656,1576230828257837062,Parking lots sounds close  Dont know if that implies autopark or not
37657,1576229147004653569,My 2nd takeaway from the Tesla AI team  There are many things they know they need to finish UTurns etc but priorities are set based safety Something may seem easy to fix to us but they are prioritizing issues to improve safety fastest
37658,1576227604444561408,Maybe they have their favorites or maybe a specific issue gets highlighted and they focus on that area
37659,1576227250298449921,Dont think of it that way  You are not mapping  Think of the snapshot as a bookmark for the team to go back and figure out what caused the behavior you reported and see if there is a nuance that perhaps needs to be addressed
37660,1576226531696705536,Lots of hard working people that care deeply about very specific issues  Constructive safely executed  video feedback is appreciated and helpful for the dev qa and planner teams
37661,1576222735985872896,If I had one takeaway from a the convos with the Tesla AI team at  They really use our  snapshots  Use them wisely 57 per drive and use them every drive
37665,1575898443045748736,These hands look different from the invite photos  Much smoother
37666,1575898109892128770,Built to last with solid engineering that stood the test of time
37667,1575877281716674565,Doors open for the invitees at 5pm  Livestream looks like it is for the keynotes going live
37668,1575876554218881025,The  Tesla  Live Stream is up and scheduled for 615pm PDT  Turn those notification reminders on  Haha I am going to be at the event in person but still turned on the notification reminder   Thank You again for the generous invite
37672,1575515976849825794,Sorry for your situation Conor  Stay Safe
37674,1575505655053668353,Cant wait to geek out and hopefully meet the team responsible for all the hard work on my turn
37676,1575457670642995201,The  are fine thanks for thinking of them too♥️🐝
37677,1575441978963238912,Me and my family are all safe but please spread the word to think and consider helping in any way the many people and families in Florida that are facing total tragedy
37678,1575301641699573760,Doors open at 5 goes until 11 I am sure the keynote and presentation will only be a very small portion of that I did have to sign a waiver that said a high performance thrilling ride in a vehicle that could cause injury or death would be available
37679,1575103235022413824,Thats the cool thing about using NFC that wont work
37681,1575074516316745728,not sure i see what you are referring too
37682,1575074176091623424,yes on the digital wallet invite
37683,1575070435196424192,It is very cool is how  continues to embrace technology and utilize digital wallets  No paper much more secure and super convenient  There are many that hoped for an invite that didnt get one I am humbled to be included Thank you for the invite
37684,1575067424495267841,This will be an amazing improvement for finding gaps on turns in cross traffic
37685,1574893579000074242,Love that  gives these kind of tips and reminders
37688,1574475512608604161,Awesome  See you there  I just got my RSVP acknowledgment
37689,1574450268732887044,Agreed  Should be an exciting event with so many possible developments  And usually we are off base on our predictions
37691,1574432174534713347,No the visualization is gone for me now
37716,1573784203237494785,I think you misunderstood me  Omar should take Ellie and I out to dinner
37719,1573442298662342675,Pressing the accelerator is a bigger intervention than you might realize if you are facing high speed  crossing traffic  You are basically taking over the toughest part of the decision the car has to make  Drive Safely
37720,1573441818993328128,I have done plenty of those Check my channel Lots of data
37721,1573426449536671754,Omar said he would take us out to dinner Thats a date
37726,1573331334302470144,No trying to figure it out
37728,1573269876793380864,Very humbled and excited
37729,1573153172486778880,Had to look that one up  It wasnt a compliment  but Im gonna give you credit for calling me out
37730,1573119576933814273,Excited to be included in this amazing upcoming  event  It will be another important day in  history
37731,1572987015091654657,Yes your cameras are compatible but your software branch is most likely going to prevent you from getting beta until the FSDBeta branch catches up to your version
37732,1572984938026123270,Joe is on the right branch you identified the NAV data update
37733,1572982350715158530,Stumped with ya… dang
37734,1572982127272116229,Hmm What build number is your car currently on Joe 2022
37735,1572976688077873155,Good clarification New cameras next month Or supply of existing cameras will be available again next month
37737,1572971354290524160,Joe what production year and model is the car that this references  Curious where the line on camera upgrade required is
37738,1572970699576479744,Thank you for this clarification  Lots of confusion in this area
37739,1572577724132380675,Syncing the drone can at times be the hardest I do it manually based on visual cues in multiple streams that align  It does look like the drone might be one frame off here  But these cars are moving fast
37746,1572280748803235843,Good analysis of the data presented  I do my best to sync everything up to within the tolerance 130 sec of the frame rate of the lowest video feed  and it looks like its in sync  so that delay you noticed might be latencyjitter  Not sure  but worth discussing
37747,1572249656842915842,Hey Twitter  Based on some feedback I did some Forward Facing Unprotected Turn testing on  v106922
37749,1572185601365118981,Good question  I do think that the horn is an important part of driving in MANY parts of the world  I dont think that an Eventual autonomous car needs to use a horn as much as HEAR other sounds such as horns and sirens in order to be aware of its surroundings
37750,1572179712339841024,These are all good items too but to be clear I am not saying autonomous driving  We have a lot of work to do to remove the driver from the seat The end to end I am referring to means start to finish drives can even be attempted
37751,1572176210263789569,AutoPark and Smart Summon are two more functions to get us closer to a feature set that allows end to end  drives  Uturns are pretty important too hopefully that is next
37753,1572034622493540352,Bummer Looking forward to watching your video  I am hearing lots of Forward Facing UPL issues I had one of those today and might do a bit more testing on that tomorrow before leaving town
37755,1572026575851225088,As soon as we have Uturn functionality this will be a great option for mitigation of risk
37756,1572025982537666560,Cant help you thereJacksonville FL
37757,1572022629116133376,Not sure if that question was directed at me or  but if it was me
37758,1572018877420240896,If the creep limit is IN the road dont ever trust it that is what it is going to use  Report it Geometry of the intersection seems to have the biggest impact on the variability for me
37759,1572016410616041474,Does it cross the blue creep limit  Or are you saying the blue creep limit is inaccurate or uncomfortable for you
37760,1572015708112027649,I can concur with this  My only issue today was front facing  And ironically those were pretty great before
37762,1571999754522853376,It is real and not actually intentional some days it happens
37763,1571998153637003264,Thank you for that support  Service is a privilege
37764,1571984301742510083,This version was amazing on these turns  You can hear it in my voice
37765,1571983831556669442,Thanks for the clarification  Drive safely everyone Onward to v10693  I saw ADAS drivers in the neighborhood again today
37766,1571970833408720896,And 106922 looks even better
37770,1571918559860920321,Hey Twitter   v106922  Memorial Park First Impressions Drive  Enjoy
37771,1571906898302992384,Its very easy with the human eye to see the deceleration and associated dip in the angle of the car when they tap their brakes
37772,1571906585982652418,I would never assume to have that much influence  No way
37773,1571905814108979204,Hey Twitter  This clip came out of my v106922 Memorial Park First Impressions drive that will be posted shortly  Very good human interaction with a driver leaving a gap
37774,1571886106643144704,Give me UTurn functionality and I will test that too
37775,1571881681141010432,This is an accurate clue you noticed  Yes  but today  it gave me the confidence it wasnt budging  previously  it would keep inching in a way that made me uncomfortable
37776,1571861393749716994,Hey Twitter Highlight 2  Here is  v106922 doing an Unprotected Left Turn in MediumHeavy TrafficCheck out the full video
37777,1571861270592110593,Hey Twitter Highlight 1  Here is  v106922 doing an Unprotected Left Turn in MediumHeavy TrafficCheck out the full video
37780,1571837078870032388,v106922  Just finished my UPLs in rush hourAll I can say  stay near your computer
37785,1571581956588015618,Lets do bothRepeat post for those that have seen this  sorry
37786,1571565161483231234,We love to speculate about this maybe one day we will know what the magician behind the curtain is doing
37787,1571564464226578433,This is funny to me  Not the lack of rain for you sorry  but the inconsistency  I literally couldnt believe it warned me but stayed engaged  Info for all to digest I guess
37788,1571563054923399168,Thank you Nick  I appreciate you listening so closely and forming your own opinions Peace
37789,1571558154973888513,We are all flawed  Especially me but I am confident in my own analysis
37790,1571551507228622850,Any updates on the progress of  v106921
37791,1571550090547920897,You can hear it too in the wheel well
37792,1571541184635338758,At 350 in the full length video I pop up the cameras and you can see the rear view has some drops on it  Just to give you a reference point
37793,1571284376771600385,In this case it was more timely than me  It did a good save with the way that car cut me off at the same time my mindset was in acceleration around the stopped vehicle
37794,1571272391367577600,Automation of airplanes and electrification of airplanes are two different problems  I feel the automation of aviation has already begun in the military  The rest is social adoption and  not technology

37799,1571235708660072449,I talk a bit about this in the video where I felt a bit of traction loss but the car handled it fine
37801,1571222128648650755,Beta is just not quite as consistent as the NoA heuristic code at the moment That is what my theory is on the delay for v11
37802,1571219921694072837,No as you can see  a disengagement did not happen

37815,1571098514192736256,From    here we go again  Out to employees now then we will see what the rollout plan looks like later As a reminder  said this point release was just a bit of polish then expecting v10693 sometime after AI Day on the 30th
37818,1570826030184820736,I see my post went completely over your head  Back to puppies you go
37821,1570781986192789504,Its amazing how the placebo effect can skew the empirical data on this when the solution you are trying to improve is already probabilistic at its core
37822,1570780697220239360,Tesla has never officially or unofficially said to calibrate cameras for an  issue  It has been tried by customers as a troubleshooting step based only on speculation
37823,1570779766135083016,If you are in the  Safety Score queue with a score above 80 what is your current software build on your car
37824,1570778314691977216,I personally have never seen calibrating cameras as effective  but others such as  have sworn that it fixed things  So the jury is still out and I dont want to say one way or another  You be the judge
37825,1570775081785368576,Could be a good strategy and without additional information from  we are just using history as a guide
37830,1570769763647000579,1 Hey Twitter  Based on  tweet that the Safety Score users down to the 80s are up next keep in mind  is on 202220x and could stay on that branch until v10693 after AI Day  To this point  has not downgraded to a lower branch to install FSD Patience
37831,1570749771882827777,Map data continues to be problematic  Asking for a push wouldnt do anything as the core maps they are updating from are not current
37832,1570740975865303041,Yes mapsnav data have been independently updated from the software several times
37833,1570734458193715201,More than likely the v106921 will be on the 202220x branch  V10693 could jump to one of the later production branches
37842,1570455488785186818,Night has never been an issue for me but that is mostly due to lighter traffic
37843,1570446465100816384,We are a long way from me buying you coffee but I still hope I lose the bet
37844,1570445167370375169,Wow  Good news for many that have been waiting and keeping a good score  Another tranche of 100K for a total of 200K  Any timing  Week or longer

37858,1569296428115148805,Congrats  and Finally to all the new  v10692 recipients  Still no word yet on new Safety Score additions  Would love to hear constructive feedback and notes after a few drives on key differences felt coming directly from 122  692
37860,1569141683878793217,With that many miles and constant innovation its inevitable  It is important  for many to realize we are still building the machine not just training it to perfection

37864,1569086220143136776,As  v10692 is now rolling out to a new group I have one more video for those that are interested in seeing my experience on the Memorial Park Drive loop  Check it out
37866,1569077508229812225,This is great news I noticed some VRU caution today too  Very justifiable and safe actions  Thank you for continuing to push this to others

41130,1577135445850214400,Twitter is now “factchecking” my tweet What a joke
41131,1577076388112191489,If the Ukraine War has proven anything its that the Russian army can barely operate beyond its supply lines in Russia The idea that it poses a threat to take over all of Europe is threat inflation
41133,1577031325583712256,Suggest you read the Afghanistan Papers You seem fixated on a minor detail instead of seeing the forest for the trees
41134,1577029761343180800,Evidently I understand it better than the foreign policy establishment which kept us there for 20 years
41136,1577026873808207872,The fact that  could be attacked as “proRussian” merely for suggesting a possible peace deal — even though he gave Starlink to the Ukrainian war effort — shows how warped and intolerant the public conversation has become

41847,1571703084086337538,When it can be available to the Southeast Asia region It was written early 2023 but so far I havent see any regulatory discussion about that
41849,1569949011062444032,stop being looking so handsome with the profile picture🤣🫶
42538,1580566255375101953,▪️Thats not true at all▪️Tesla said that to reach the current 50 annual growth target theyve got enough cash flow  but trust me should cash flow be consistently beyond that theyll find ways to grow even faster 😉▪️Secondly the EV credits arent Teslaonly
42539,1580504276358803458,▪️Thats exactly the point of EV credits to make EVs less expensive over time by expanding production capacity▪️Theres a time delay between credits  lowered consumer prices
42540,1580503860871049218,▪️Correct but with a time lag of months  years▪️Your argument fundamentally misses the very long lead times of expansion of EV production capacity but EV credits do flow into more capacity  benefit consumers▪️Absent credits EV expansion would be slower  more expensive
42542,1580495565749891073,▪️Theres still an indirect benefit to Tesla consumers if Tesla earns higher margins they can expand EV factories faster▪️With more capacity EV prices drop▪️So with EV production capacity limits theres still a benefit to consumers from the EV credits with a time delay
42557,1580323073747668992,▪️Starlink Terminals dont work without nearby ground stations Starlink users in Ukraine is supported via ground stations close to the Ukrainian border  this way they are harder to target by Russia  it also saves Internet bandwidth for Ukraine
42558,1580310545021820928,▪️Its over 15000 terminals  SpaceX 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗹𝘆 subsidizes terminal costs  fees▪️HW cost alone is 1000terminal▪️Monthly fees 1000year waived▪️Billions of RD not in monthly fee▪️SpaceX installed  extended ground stations around Ukraine for 250000 users
42559,1580300491673677824,▪️The US government would donate 10000 such “Boeing Starlink” terminals valued 22 billion for the first year with another 12 billion per year network service fees and the figures would be accurate▪️As it is Elon Musk is underselling the value of Starlink big time
42560,1580299343697170432,▪️Starlink is also a natural monopoly a one of a kind service you cannot get anywhere else a value 𝗳𝗮𝗿 more than its nominal terminalmonthly costs▪️If SpaceX was run by Boeing then the “Battlefield Hardened” 100mbit version would cost 100k upfront 10kmonth
42561,1580298281141563392,▪️The 1500 barely covered the hardware costs at that time SpaceX is selling Starlink terminals at a loss to invest into a recurring revenue stream of 100month fees▪️SpaceX also has billions of RD costs  which it is not  adding to the terminal cost to grow the market
42562,1580287544595730433,▪️Of Ukraines Starlink service Musk donated 97 while USAid donated 3  so far▪️USAid percentage dropping because SpaceX keeps donating▪️Even for the 1330 USAid terminals SpaceX assumes ongoing costs 1000year  a substantial Russian cyberattack  ASAT threat
42563,1580284383562723330,▪️Elon Musk unequivocally denied both the claims  the substance of Bremmers claim which then Bremmer failed to back up with evidence▪️Could Bremmer be a Putin information warfare deep asset Bremmer first leaked Putins secret Helsinki meeting with Trump
42564,1580281576427921408,▪️Fact check the frequent claim that the US government paid for Ukraines Starlink access is 𝗳𝗮𝗹𝘀𝗲 rated 5 Pinocchios 🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥▪️Fact SpaceX  Elon Musk donated over 10000 Starlink terminalsservice worth over 80m while USAid donated 3m worth of terminals

42582,1579416712843493377,▪️The exact position log of the satellite tells SpaceX whether the virtual intercept was successful or not and if it was unsuccessful how close the satellite managed to get to the virtual ICBM▪️This technology could be improved iteratively with the usual SpaceXTesla method
42583,1579416131802394624,▪️SpaceX could in fact test ICBM interception purely virtually without anyone knowing or noticing much a virtual ICBM is launched  testintercepted by a deorbiting satellite▪️Coordinates of the virtual ICBM are passed to the satellite realtime which it tries to hit
42584,1579415446054670336,▪️But what I like in your scheme is how an intercept of an ICBM by a Starlink satellite is basically just an accelerated version of a natural deorbiting burn  trajectory▪️SpaceX could test this to perfection with minimum cost using the natural EOL deorbiting of satellites
42585,1579414260874379264,▪️This is how it looks like today  see how theres basically just two characteristic velocities and very little retrograde component well none
42586,1579413604960718850,▪️To counter that evasion tactic Starlink would have to use multiple shells with velocities well distributed in retrograde and other orbits  which is pretty incompatible with how the constellation is being built today with synchronized velocities
42587,1579413147618004994,▪️Δv depends greatly on the orbit of the satellite  the ICBM▪️Because most Starlink satellites move in a shell in very predictable orbits ICBMs launched in the same direction as Starlink orbits could evade much of the natural Δv that comes from Starlinks orbital velocity
42588,1579412326046117889,▪️ I also optimistically assumed that materials science has materials that would withstand the centrifugal forces generated Worstcase the design could be changed to a magnetic ring accelerator releasing multiple interceptors
42589,1579411647785205760,▪️Rotators could also be spun down via the same mechanism for periodic automated maintenance checks Wouldnt want a rotator to separate spontaneously due to material fatigue

56372,1574898283767635984,Is it Eau de toilette or Eau de Parfum
57463,1579966876779970570,A candidate sympathetic to Russia 🥴
57464,1579961666955272193,Ah I see your point In the context here I was saying ousted as in a coup I should have been more specific
57465,1579953260555038720,Of course the results dont reflect the mindset after the coup or after an 8 year almost 9 year civil war between Ukrainian forces and the separatist regions That was simply a response to a previous tweet
57466,1579951200610705408,I dont claim to be an expert but there are interviews with people in those regions There support cant be denied Ultimately my interest is in selfdetermination Its unimportant to me whether an oblast votes to stay with Ukraine join Russia or become independent
57467,1579945585389752320,Trump lost an election in 2020 he wasnt ousted  He completed his term of 4 years  Even the leaders of his own party admit that he lost on the state level in Georgia and Arizona typical Republic voting states in presidential elections
57468,1579922038948790278,Alaska voted for Trump If Trump had been ousted then perhaps they would decide Washington no longer reflects their voices Alaska then declares independence and the US starts a war with Alaska  Of course Russia unlikely to interfere in that hypothetical because of nukes
57469,1579920064878641152,1 There are articles in western media talking about negotiations in April  2 I absolutely understand that people in western Ukraine and not even all those in Eastern Ukraine want that but here we are unfortunately
57470,1579916252436627456,Those deaths occurred in the Donbas war not in Crimea
57471,1579913919027884033,Im from the heart of the US and love my country but I do not like what my government has been doing around the world since WWII Im not proRussian or proUkrainian Yes many of the people I follow post things that typically counter the western narrative
57472,1579912097454247936,Trump went back on many of his campaign promises but his supporters did not care nor did they wish to oust him Im not a Trump supporter but had he been ousted I can imagine the US could potentially have civil war or regions wanting to break away
57473,1579909886359764992,Then how did 15000 Ukrainians die between 2014 and 2022
57474,1579909576107122688,I am aware of all the maps from 2010 going forward to today  It was relevant to the discussion I was having with another person
57475,1579908829734612993,Obviously it does not but there has been an escalation of events since 2014 that have led to this point unfortunately
57476,1579904871150784512,Zelensky ran on a platform of peace and to unite the country and negotiate with Putin There had been an 8 year civil war going on from 2014 to early 2022 prior to the Russian military operation I believe mostly in the Donbas region
57477,1579899511925006337,Yep Im in agreement with that After 5 years of a civil war people wanted someone that was going to bring peace and unite the country again  Zelenski ran on that platform of peace and negotiation with Putin
57478,1579895047885328384,Yes the interviews from Eastern Ukrainians living in the area directly counter your argument Also a sympathetic Russian candidate did win in 2010 in Ukraine because of the eastern parts of the country That president was ousted in 2014 and after CrimeaLPRDPR all broke away
57479,1579892964914270208,Its literally a proxy war The US does not want peace talks because they want to use the war to try to weaken Russia Since WWII the US has never invested in war because of human rights its always because of power or natural resources
57481,1579886884935061506,A Russian leaning party in Ukraine couldnt win now because they have been banned by Zelenski What democracy Anyways I agree that a Russian leaning candidate couldnt win after 2014 without Crimea and even more so now likely without Donbas
57482,1579884986379177984,Nobody has to like the war but I simply answered your question Peace talks are needed and thanks to the US and NATO encouraging Ukraine to engage in a proxy war instead of peace talks its likely that Ukraine will lose the eastern portion of the country
57483,1579882944596172800,Yes that was after the military operation started but my point to bring that up was that Ukraine has never been forced to engage in diplomacy  Clearly diplomacy did exist prior to the Russian troops in Ukraine of this year
57484,1579881863627567104,France and Germany mediated the agreement It was definitely diplomacy and an agreement that no one forced Ukraine to sign They could have walked away just like they did in late April of this year
57485,1579879884981403650,Minsk I and Minsk II Putin was there to negotiate both of those agreements
57486,1579879546115223552,Minsk I and Minsk II for the previous president before Zelenski  Both sides accuse the other of not following the agreement
57495,1579219170767822848,Russia went into Crimea in 2014 LPR and DPR declared independence that year Russia did back them financially but the US does the same in Syria and we still call that a civil war
57496,1579215524109557762,Definition of civil war a war between opposing groups of citizens of the same country
57497,1579213588668899333,So you are suggesting Ukrainians were not fighting Ukrainians
57498,1579111727618494464,Youre right it wasnt a civil war after 15000 dead it was just a strong friendly argument with bullets
57499,1578749563355033601,Do you even know that a civil war has been going on since 2014 after the LPR and DPR declared independence
57500,1578488930416357376,Misconception because actually the US pointed nuclear weapons at the USSR first in Turkey and Western Europe and then Russia responded with missies in Cuba
57501,1578445201181265920,Im well aware of his map but as you said same applies things have changed in 10 years as well considering the 8 year civil war in Eastern Ukraine since 2014 Also its not just Russians killing Ukrainians or vice versa  Its a civil war
57502,1578423207991705601,No that was my bad  There was a speech taken out of context from the previous president
57503,1578161987930189824,Is that not because that was before the president that the East of Ukraine and Crimea overwhelmingly voted for was ousted  Then theres also the 8 years of war  I hear a lot that its all Putins fault but that seems oversimplified
57504,1578131561714778122,If you hate democracy then thats your thing People and local officials decide if and when to vote  Its not on some predetermined schedule
57505,1578130528691257365,Regularly no but if and when the people or local officials want a vote then give them a vote  Thats democracy or a are we all slaves to the state that we live in
57506,1578087826100477952,Its not very hard to fathom when my country has notoriously been involved in countless regime change operations in the Middle East and Latin America as far back as 1953  Its very questionable when the US gets involved because usually in involves natural resources or power
57507,1578087089572225024,Zelensky was elected in 2019 and the previous president negotiated 2 times with the Minsk agreements that were not followed according to both sides  Your tweet seems to ignore everything that played out between 2014 and 2022
57508,1578083134708514819,But to be fair that doesnt include internal movement data but interested to see it if you know where it is
57509,1578082878616903683,I just checked my source and Russia is still number one according to Oxford using data from the UN
57510,1578079911746719747,Yes Im an idiot for thinking an 8 year civil war could possibly change opinions in the East of Ukraine
57514,1578046288536510466,That map was in 2012 before the civil war started in 2014 They still had the “proRussian President” Víktor Yanukóvich who was selected in 2010 basically only by Eastern Ukraine  What peace are you speaking of to be made in 2012
57515,1577923876234960896,A lot of you dont seem to understand that people of a region determine what they want to vote on when they want to vote on it
57517,1577918879162138624,Obviously the majority of Ukraine still wants to be Ukraine
57518,1577918362952286210,Yes I agree with you  One should look at all of the election results over the last few decades to better understand Ukraines history  Picking something from 30 or 10 years ago because it fits what you want to say isnt helpful
57519,1577917434706776068,One does not need to live in Ukraine to understand the concept of trends new voters and historical events changing minds and attitudes in a region  My point is there is a lot of events that have unfolded in Ukraine since 1991 especially since 2014
57520,1577914057079783425,The US media are not known for being proRussia but even still they wrote on the Azov Battalion which very much exists and definitely has expressed extremist views in the past but that doesnt equal all of Ukraine
57521,1577912672888266752,Mate at least read the entire thread before you comment  We already know that but thanks anyways
57522,1577911266881986562,Then why did LPR and DPR declare independence in 2014
57523,1577910814576721920,Sure its just a total fantasy that Ukraine has been at war since 2014
57524,1577910430705614848,Basically people of a region dont have the right to selfdetermination is what I am getting from this statement
57525,1577909756685164545,If the US citizens were requesting it or if a certain state were requesting it then fair game but thats not the state of affairs for the moment in the US
57526,1577908736118644739,See my other response  All things must be taken in context and over long periods of time A lot has happened in 30 years and even 10 years  My point is still valid for both
57527,1577907745310883841,I was referring to this speech but perhaps its out of context
57528,1577906986011791365,Yes much of Ukraine wants to remain as Ukraine
57529,1577905014890283009,Petro Poroshenko in 2019
57530,1577900632601755648,No I have seen all of the maps and understand them in their respective contexts  Zelensky overwhelming won in 2019 because he ran on peace with Eastern Ukraine and stated he would negotiate with Putin Its also worth mentioning his opponent openly talked about apartheid
57531,1577891854238076928,Right because Russia propaganda is so influential that they forced western media to write articles on the Azov Battalion as far back as 2014 🙄
57532,1577889025318338563,Yep no worries Trump abandoned the TPP agreement and many other important agreements after many years of negotiations but I dont see that as grounds for a coup even though the Dems tried to impeach him on bogus charges and Im no Trump lover
57533,1577882296799068160,Yes thats true he delayed a decision on EU membership and was deciding between a loan from Russia or the IMF if Im not mistaken  The EU and US then backed a coup  Were always promoting “democracy” around the world
57534,1577878057716776960,Theres a lot more context than just the results of a vote from 30 years ago
57535,1577877640194801666,I wish I had the time to find all the videos I have watched and articles I have read to show you but I simply dont have the time 🫤
57536,1577876700591005696,Its up to the people that live there to decide their fate whether it is to join stay leave or go independent  It just happened with South Sudan recently and nobody seems to be arguing against that to my knowledge
57537,1577875977853616130,Certainly it would be much better to hold a vote with all parties present like you are suggesting but I dont know if it will happen  Certainly the results appear dodgy given the circumstances but Im not buying the forced to vote at gun point argument
57538,1577873584168603648,They left that doesnt appear to be forcing people to vote The US did the same thing in Iraq to protect the ballots  not to force people to vote at gun point
57539,1577871025571774470,There were international observers  There are being threatened with sanctions now  Some were even from Europe  Certainly I dont mind another vote for those regions but thats not my decision
57540,1577870415279656960,Millions of people live or lived in those regions and lets say 50000 have died which is a generous number and is tragic no matter the number and half fled The majority fled to Russia from the East from what I have read and those people were allowed to vote in the referendum
57541,1577869406180413451,I have seen this one video but I have seen a lot more from American journalists on the ground monitoring the voting in the polling centers and soldiers werent threatening them as gun point Also is that a Russian soldier or a local soldier from that region
57542,1577864942459420672,I mean I know that the Azov Battalion was attacking people in Eastern Ukraine which would break the Minsk agreements but Im more interested in hearing the other side of that argument
57543,1577864118568099840,I have seen none of that from the American and foreign journalists I follow reporting from the ground in those areas  I have only seen claims thus far from western media  Open to looking at something you might have though
57544,1577863570250924033,Zelensky did nothing to stop the Azov battalion from attacking people in Eastern Ukraine A large majority of people that migrated in these areas due to the civil war went to Russia and not Western Ukraine  Of course there were some that went west
57545,1577862090353688576,Correct not recognized until 2022 however the leaders of the selfproclaimed LPR and DPR regions were present during those negotiations I dont know how it all played out and of course both sides will point fingers  Its highly likely they both were breaking the terms
57546,1577859153334341635,Yes Im well aware of those results  That was because the opponent openly wanted to create and Ukrainian apartheid state and Zelensky ran on a propeace with Eastern Ukraine and negotiate with Putin platform  Seems like an obvious choice for those living in Eastern Ukraine
57547,1577858005005205507,The local governments organized the votes to leave Ukraine  I never said the Ukrainian government would like the results Of course people question those results so just hold the vote again Let the people decide as that is what democracy is all about
57548,1577855721022038017,The people of any country and government no matter the size decide what they want to vote on when they want to vote on it
57549,1577855461298241539,LPR and DPR in 2014 were not part of Ukraine  They declared independence in 2014 and yes Russia helped fund them after  Are you referring to another region of Ukraine
57550,1577854835805884417,Again referendums are determined by local county state and federal governments  The people and politicians decide when they vote not matter the subject
57551,1577853754275135490,People of a region get to chose when they vote  There is no timetable
57552,1577853373361135616,People of a certain region have a right to selfdetermination  If a region has enough support to leave the US then that is their business  The US does not have ownership over its citizens nor does any country  Humans are not property
57553,1577850786473775106,Putin didnt force Ukraine to sign the Minsk agreements and then not follow them nor did Russia force the Azov Battalion to terrorize the people of eastern Ukraine for 8 years  There are very clear reasons why eastern Ukraine wants to leave or be independent
57554,1577850022653313024,Over 30 years ago but surely nothing has changed in 30 years
57555,1577848729176080384,Zelensky ran on peace with the East and negotiating with Putin The exact opposite has happened
57558,1577356293949607939,Based on some American reporters there on the ground any soldiers around where from those regions and were not Russian soldiers They claimed the Russian soldiers are at the border
57559,1577342640865087496,Humans are not property they have a right to selfdetermination
57563,1577023561914408960,That vote took place 31 years ago and much has happened in 30 years Humans of the time have a right to self determination and are not bound by the vote of people in the past  Even people alive that voted then could have changed their position on the matter
58454,1579981350144090112,Surrender does but you some time
58455,1579981143122010113,Depends what losing looks like Sort of subjective

59273,1578071877016223746,Oh great now everyone is going to attack you for being an armchair zoologist
59275,1578066737010036738,There is a non zero chance that calls for deescalation increase WW3 chancesThis is a very good point and one that is counterintuitive I dont claim to know the best path forward but there is certainly a pattern of Russian aggression following appeasement
59276,1578057719856209926,While we clearly are engaged in a proxy war I think thats probably not the most accurate way to describe it And maybe Im wrong but I do think Ukraine is more in the drivers seat than the USBut none of that is a reason that we shouldnt try for peace so I do agree w you
59277,1578055601510309888,I dont think you do which is why I really hope that my assessment about the commitment of the Ukrainians is inaccurate
59278,1578055259695587328,I agree its highly biased and I try to temper a lot of what I hear in there Oddly though whether the war crimes actually happened or not doesnt really matter with respect to the likelihood of a negotiated settlement if the Ukrainians believe that they did occur
59279,1578054661973622787,My view is that we should seek paths to deescalation as urgently as possible but also that that outcome is unlikely due to the Ukrainians being unwilling to negotiate Id love to wave a magic wand to eliminate the risk of nuclear war
59280,1578052261368004611,There are many more but heres a few
59281,1578051932190556160,I listen to  quite regularly which reports in detail on these atrocities and I feel is a good gauge for general Ukranian sentiment If that venue is a decent proxy then Ukraine is highly committed to seeing this fight out to the end
59282,1578050826412638209,No I actually want a negotiated peace like Elon is suggesting My point is that its in the Ukrainians hands much more so than ours
59283,1578050221182943234,Im also not saying definitively that all of these things happened or that all Russians engaged in these acts But it certainly seems to be the belief within Ukraine that these crimes are part of a campaign of terrorism If thats the case I cant see a path for negotiation
59284,1578049610567880704,The alleged war crimes include widespread rape incl of girls 10 castration of POWs torture kidnapping and forced relocation of civilians and deliberate targeting of civilian populations These seem to be underreported in media and its why negotiation is unlikely imo
59285,1578048404952944642,I get where Elon is coming from but unfortunately I think a peaceful negotiated settlement is highly unlikely The atrocities committed by the Russians are simply to flagrant and personal for the Ukrainians to be willing to accept anything other than unconditional surrender
59293,1577742334300749832,Why does  just show y Im really looking forward to the improved functionality of 26 letters on the website one of these days
59300,1577630273583341571,My favorite reason Tesla wouldnt be able to launch a robotaxi was Greg Wester saying the door handles are too confusing for the general public

59302,1577450144911413248,In the span of about 3 hours we got confirmation that  would remove Teslas sensors and Twitters censors
59320,1577087487595642880,At this point I think the hypothetical peace deals being bandied about are not practical simply because Ukraine wont agree to them The war crimes and just the invasion in general have completely rallied the entire society Im not sure we have choices here
59329,1576961058547257344,If you think  cares about PE ratios you really dont understand how he thinks and what motivates him

59366,1576239686309531650,If I were a WS Analyst I wouldnt ascribe value either but that doesnt mean thats the right answer Imo the right way to value it is as a real option but its highly unlikely well have confidence in the ability  margin potential in day the next 4 years
59368,1576215623822376960,That sounds true in theory but if theyre so smart why did they not get it in late 2019 when Tesla proved they were profitable 15x moves shouldnt happen if WS is as perceptive as you suggest
59369,1576184888562438146,Im highly skeptical that Wall Street will actually get it
59380,1575971198173052928,Since when do Tesla events start precisely on time

62128,1580248354763571200,Tesla built inhouse its business operating system
62129,1580239096005337098,I get what youre saying and I didnt mean for it to come across that way but its impossible to describe it otherwise within 280 characters lol
62130,1580237968387604481,Tesla designing and building its own bespoke operating system inhouse is a VERY BIG deal and few truly understand and appreciate this
62131,1580234402813968403,TSLA has developed inhouse most of the core technology that runs all aspects of its business — basically  chose to vertically integrate its own central nervous system that integrates  streamlines all its business processes  seamlessly executes its strategy

62141,1579899737691795456,This new revelation further explains why TWTR board members went from servile  wooing to lock in  onto the board to panicked  defensive when Elon said he wanted to buy
62142,1579873397684998145,The special considerations and terms Twitter wanted were not worth a meager 34B in savings to ElonCould be a matter of principles andor 4D chess… time will tell 😁
62143,1579870718434881536,Nope Get your facts straight Twitter is the one that offered a lower price in exchange for special considerations and terms Elon declined
62144,1579858222298857473,TWTR knew Pieter Mudge Zatco was going to whistleblow as far back as January 2022 intentionally made materially false representations in the merger agreement hoping  would be the proverbial bagholder of their ongoing fraud  misconduct
62146,1579838554221735936,Its credible testimonial evidence from a disinterested witness thats corroborated by documentary evidenceElon isnt saying anything Mudge was deposed
62148,1579828339313082369,Mudge testified to it under oath during his deposition
62149,1579827277940285440,Twitter had a legal obligation to take reasonable steps to preserve evidenceIn this instance  took steps to destroy material evidence it knew to be very damning while it was on notice for breach and it did so only 14 days prior to filing its lawsuit against Elon Musk
62152,1579704541284798464,TWTR accuses  of potentially having let hypothetical evidence be autodeleted because he may have used the Signal app to discuss the Twitter dealMeanwhile  intentionally had material evidence secretly destroyed and paid 78 million to secure its destruction
62153,1579693470981423104,Mudge was fired by  on Jan 18 2022 and TWTR signed the merger agreement on Apr 25 2022Elon put  on notice for breach on Jun 6 2022Twitter reached a settlement agreement with Mudge on Jun 28 2022 Elons Bday and had evidence destroyed22
62154,1579693467105914881,Yes TWTR and Peiter Mudge Zatko reached a settlement agreement on June 28 2022 — This means  demanding that evidence be destroyed is legally very problematic for the Twitter board of directors given what was happening with the merger agreement with  12
62155,1579686936431972352,Wow noA preeminent network security expert with an impeccable reputation is fired by the newlyappointed CEO because he refused to lie and mislead the board of directors After which said CEO attempts to silence him and have him destroy the corroborating evidence
62156,1579670316678549506,NOTHING TO SEE HERE — Just TWTR directors paying exSecurity Head Peiter Mudge Zatko 78 million to destroy evidence of their fraud while keeping s presumptive owner  in the dark both pre and postsigning of the merger agreement
62162,1579562021032693760,I didnt say I agreed with your premise only that I accepted it for sake of argumentIf NATO gets involved and destroys Russian military bases its an allout declaration of war and the probability of allout nuclear war increases exponentially
62164,1579558889259139072,Even if I accept the premise of your scenario where radiation fallout from a tactical nuke in Ukraine would spread to neighboring NATOmember countries show me where in the NATO charter it says that this is considered a declaration of war against NATO
62166,1579555965837676544,How would a tactical nuke in Ukraine trigger a war declaration by NATO
62169,1579551926026637312,“US will prob obliterate his military”The instant that starts its a de facto declaration of war by the USYou think Russia or any country for that matter will let itself be obliterated without any form of retaliation

62374,1574904713979600908,I think DMC340U is not for prototypes but for making  iterating diecast molds inhouse because molds have to be replaced after 150k cycles I believe  has mentioned front  rear Gigacastings are meant to require zero CNC machining and do not even have datums

62440,1572999026118631424,ExactlyTwitter could show that its spamdetection scripts are adequate but if it cant see the spam because the content from the spam accounts is made invisible it cant detect itI would wager that this spam account is not invisible to the mDAUcounting algorithm tho

62506,1572322663393263616,It was revealed to Elon during the 1st meeting with Twitter postsigning and confirmed through discoveryThats why 70 of mDAUs are not monetized because if they were advertisers would freak out 90 of ad revenue is generated by only 30 of mDAUs
62508,1572319555439022083,An account thats deemed an mDAU and thats active on  every day of the quarter would contribute 1 full mDAU to the average quarterly mDAU figureContrary to its SEC filings TWTR has now revealed that it does in fact count suspended fake accounts in its quarterly mDAU

62592,1570853753821229056,Seems  reasons from the unsupported premise TWTR has not misrepresented anything to anyone and has acted with best efforts good faith in all thingsLongstanding fraud is seldom revealed by due diligence or by asking questions

79530,1577970323898732546,Elon how can you use a poll from before the war and claim that some Ukrainians still want to be part of RussiaSeriously that doesnt make sense or prove anything
79545,1577762131352686615,No offense but your question reveals that you dont understand how the occupancy network worksUltrasonic sensors are not needed to park your car perfectly if they would humans would have them
79546,1577745416615075840,Worse the corruption  constant lies within the system have led to an inability to learn from past mistakesRussians do not know what they are fighting for  the army is exhausted  its soldiers demoralizedIt will not be easy but Ukraine will win this war without concessions

79582,1577239612707119105,The backlash Elon is experiencing has nothing to do with him taking sides because he confirmed he supports UkraineIts about Elon supporting intentionally or not a false FUD narrative that Russian propaganda has been sowing for more than a decade
79585,1577083619306516480,Former US 🇺🇸 General Patreus has defined very well and in great detail what severe means you may want to watch his interviewNobody knows what will make Putin back down but we know he understands only one language and that is military strength
79586,1577080510895239168,How can you even think of compromising with an aggressor who declares the genocide of your people as the goal of the warWorse Russia will not stop if you find an agreement and other autocratic regimes will feel emboldened to do the sameIt is not just about one conflict
79587,1577077865681588225,China will not support Russia for their own domestic and international political reasonsIf Russia is using tactical nuclear weapons they will lose the war even quicker because the answer from Nato will be severeNukes are a serious threat but there will be no WW3
79588,1577074283594993664,Emmet if you want to stop the loss of life your only option is to support UkraineThere is no peace you can make with Putin bc he does not care about human lifeFrankly anyone who is informed about what has happened since Russia started the war supports Ukraine for a reason

80329,1569782544878702596,This should also cover a situation when just the train engine is moving on the tracks without any attached wagons
80330,1569770757340958722,A simple IF statement should fix the problem as  should have all the information and maps of the train tracks If trailer like object is moving on the train track interpret it as a Train

84993,1580263794898776064,Then what ARE you basing your blood emeralds story on if not for the statements of Elon and Errol  Because  again  the ENTIRE STORY comes from Elon and Errol
84994,1580262884063707136,Because people believing whatever BS makes them happy and attacking anyone who lets reality intrude on their fantasies will DEFINITELY make this world a better place   🙄
84995,1580262660683100160,I mean I literally said that theres plenty of reasons to be mad at him ElonCanDoNoWrong people get mad at me on Twitter practically every day But how dare I correct misinformation Better to believe lies Insulate yourself from facts Make up whatever you want
84996,1580262139213754368,Me encountering people who respond to correction of misinformation with insults because they prefer to believe the misinformation
85016,1579964107620777985,Again everything is flexible  A stated redline is just one partys bid to discourage you from crossing it Each party has to assess A how real it is and B whether theres a way to come in at the goal sidewaysBut you say you didnt talk to Putin so no matter
85017,1579963746361180164,So Putin wants the Suwalki Gap NATO says theyll use nukes to defend it Lets say Putin actually believes it Hey what do you know theres a Suwalki Independence Movement Angry locals They take key installations Demand Russian peacekeepers to come in to protect them
85018,1579963304168284160,And after he took it he saw that the responses he encountered were weak So he did it again in Donbas this time somewhat more overt And when it started floundering due to UA military resistance he even massdeployed RU regular units while denying it
85019,1579962990623096832,He didnt know how the west would react with Ukraine in 2014 So he engaged in hybrid warfare Pretended that the little green men taking Crimea were Ukrainians not his Spetznaz Pretended it was civil war  Kept confusion and doubt for long enough to avoid consequences
85020,1579962686779326465,But lets say that Putin does believe it he wont take it at face value hell probe constantly  again you cant take claims at face value  That means he wont attack rightNo again hell look for a workaround To come in sideways
85021,1579962410215309314,Much easier to just take the shame of breaking a treaty obligation than to condemn NYC Chicago LA and so many other cities to burn after all So they constantly have to reassure that they actually DO mean it And in turn assure Putin that they mean it
85022,1579962078810767360,NATO for example constantly has to reassure eastern Europe that it will use nukes to defend them Why I mean Article 5 implies it right Why having to keep saying it Its a will they actually pull the trigger and accept full strategic nuclear war to defend Latvia question
85023,1579961732457725956,In short you CANNOT take stated claims at face value A claim is a Negotiating Position Each side has to evaluate the positions of the others and assess how much actual reality there is to them which is no easy task And even where there is reality to come in sideways
85024,1579961425531142144,By contrast anyone can just say Ill use nukes to get what I want They can say it every day a bully taking your lunch money every day But of course you cannot accept that situation and you know that their standard for committing suicide is much higher than that
85025,1579960998420942848,Youll try to argue for automated retaliation  That orders have already been given That automated systems have already been built With as few humans in the loop as possible That everything is locked in Unavoidable if you dont do X  Hands are tied No human to say no
85026,1579960759630843905,Because youll then have escalated from losing one city to losing everything just to make the enemy lose everything to But youve still lost everythingHence threats of nuclear weapons use are usually taken with skepticism So those threatening try to tie their own hands
85027,1579960688336076800,One can say that theyre going to use nuclear weapons which is a powerful threat But who will actually pull the trigger knowing what theyre risking Even if you have an entire city wiped out by an enemy launching nuclear weapons at you do you really fire back
85028,1579959820178051073,Basically Gee I understand your threats and I may be willing to concede to them but my people wont let me Sorry my hands are tied Youll have to soften your positionDiscussions involving nuclear weaponry are an extreme version of this
85029,1579959535112171521,Each party in a negotiation has an incentive to play a maximalist scenario and to deliberately bind their own hands to that maximalist scenario For example a president of a democracy might say that they cant do X themselves they legally have to put it to a vote  hands bound
85030,1579959156345573377,Well thats that On the offchance that it ISNT actually that though do understand that negotiations are a technical field involving extensive game theory and peoples professed stances and red lines dont actually inherently match up with their real ones
85032,1579955690189516800,VICE was just reporting on what Bremmer said Nothing wrong with that so long as its attributed  The question is where BREMMER got what he wrote
85070,1579526697942388736,Though of course if he had said Meh I can always have more I guarantee you people like you would STILL be defending him
85071,1579526460137963521,Its not ambiguous even at the best of times let alone when it comes after I have good relationships with my other children 🤦‍♀️Might as well have added meh I can always have more
85080,1579418781990158337,Russia would probably invite him for propaganda purposesIts important that he knows what to expect and for that that he understands what happened there
85081,1579418305307168769,So if he goes there he probably WILL find proRussian responses and few antiRussian responses Because anyone willing to speak up is either gone or dead replaced by those who will carry the message Russia want to say  any remaining opposition knows well to shut up
85082,1579417951035609088,Note hed probably want to visit Crimea andor the LDNR too So youd need to make sure he understands the methods Russia used to eliminate opposition How people fled were replaced with Russians  anyone remaining willing to rock the boat was deported tortured or killed
85083,1579416737216614400,Thats clever    They could eg readily simulate inaccurates in early trajectory data too issuing corrections over time
85084,1579416332826972161,And theyd have it onhand as an emergency maneuvering system too  Im sure other satellites operators would be greatly appreciative of that
85085,1579415780785270785,So lets say youre aiming for NYC What trajectory do you choose where no Starlink satellite can impact with a high net dV
85086,1579415386960801792,Again IMHO KISS  A simple hypergolic or even solid satellite stage puts the whole mass  cross section into an intercept trajectory and retains the satellites guidance comms  orientation controls en route dV could be determined by timing and adjusted by offaxis
85087,1579414889436958721,See for example TSS1 TSS1R ATEx KITE MAST all three STARS missions ESTCube1  Flexible rotating tethers are surprisingly difficult to deploy I imagine rigid would work better but theres more engineering required and mass penalty
85088,1579413037374930944,Main problems are TRL and intercept difficulty for a small unguided projectile  Things spinning in space is actually surprisingly difficult Easiest is just to intercept with the satellite
85089,1579411505287933954,In a nuclear war scenario I dont think anyone is going tobe too worried ablut orbital debris in LEO  Main problems are TRL And a much smaller interceptor with no onboard maneuvering capability
85090,1579410472784498694,Doesnt mean theyre guaranteed to succeed just that they do try
85091,1579410107691020288,dV will average many thousands of ms    Even hitting a lowdensity solar array would be like an explosion of a dozen or so kg of TNT but with an even faster shock wave Discerning decoys is one of the main goals of nuclear early warning tracking systems
85098,1579388145376055298,I mean if youre this insistent on rejecting reality and substituting whatever fantasy makes you feel better you be you  But the rest of us here are going to rely on actual factsTheres tons of reasons to be mad at Elon This is not one of them
85099,1579387929545539584,ParaphraseErrol I had a stake in a small Zambian emerald mine that earned me a couple hundred k which dried up before Elon leftElon YepOther sources ZeroYou No you had a multibillion dollar Apartheid South African blood emerald mine  paid for everything
85100,1579387403634356224,These have all been repeatedly studied by journalists for example Ashley Vance and there are photographs  As for the emeralds the entire story comes from Elon and his father and both have confirmed the above details so exactly what more do you want
85102,1579382148129501185,The older Starlink satellites deployed can provide a 4m² target for the intercept The new cellcapable ones are MUCH larger though Im not sure of the dimensions
85103,1579381433877270528,Thats why I specified chemical    Would need to alter the design  Only needs enough dV to dogleg a couple degrees 2 12 degrees dogleg plus some dV for acceldecel might let 48 inner shell satellites intercept More dV  exponentially more intercept possibilities
85116,1579268455554904066,Elons concern sees to be global strategic thermonuclear warfare not tactical
85117,1579266158653755392,Starlink sats ought to have have enough chemical thrust to quickly dogleg to an intercept trajectory just sayin
85124,1579240003648901120,Its not at all complicated Literally days after she turned 18 she filed for a legal name and gender change representing herself in court no lawyer and went out of her way in the process to say that she wants nothing to do with her father
85130,1579233828929175553,Then being Elon is synonymous with being a heartless asshole  You dont talk about your kids that way Ever Thats inhuman
85131,1579231989756235776,Talking about how he still has other kids who like him then saying cant win them all to a FT journalist could not possibly be more dismissive of the loss of her  If he does still love her hes trying to convince the world and consequently her that he doesnt
85132,1579207098608799744,He said it out loud in the middle of an FT article and are you seriously asking why I would judge a person for saying cant win them all to the media about their eldest child not wanting to be associated with them
85133,1579195051699163136,Cant win them all is a phrase that indicates that something didnt go as hoped but it doesnt bother you  EgAw got a gutter ball at the end Oh well cant win them allI tried out for the lead in the play but only got a minor character Cant win them all Etc
85134,1579192088494628864,Its basically Meh its fine I have other kids Im fine with one of them hating me
85135,1579189462500016128,Sigh  please tell me you didnt ACTUALLY say Cant win them all in reference to your daughter not wanting to be associated with you   😞
85136,1579188877570342912,What so that they can do it AGAIN for the NEXT thing they want to take overGiving in to blackmail just encourages more blackmail while empowering and proliferating blackmailers
85137,1579185805846671360,Then theres regional changes For example while high latitude cultivation would suffer the drop in temperatures in many equatorial regions would be desirable  encourage cultivation  Just looking at existing croplands gives a misleading picture
85138,1579184626614300673,All the food we throw away as it doesnt meet quality standards starving people will take it Eg my potatoes this year were infested by wireworms No store would want them today but you bet starving people would eat them
85139,1579184214561689600,Id also add that I think any study like they did is naive It assumes business as usual rather than adjustment to the new situation which OF COURSE would happen Colder climate  less crops like corn more crops like potatoes Food shortages  no grainfed meat Etc
85140,1579183216082432000,Early in our history the human population was reduced down to no more than a couple thousand individuals by some unknown catastrophe possibly due to the eruption of Toba though thats controversial Thats a genetic bottleneckAnd still not extinction
85141,1579182596075900928,And again your threads whole point is that option A is extinction and if you keep making decision A over and over sooner or later humanity goes extinctExcept that option A isnt even close to extinction  Its not even a big genetic bottleneck
85142,1579181851633012736,If you want global extinction events your best bet is probably genetically engineered viruses  But nobody except a doomsday cult would deliberately make and release one that deliberately kills everyone
85143,1579181297028980739,Sure youre not thinking of this one
85144,1579181029738545152,To reiterate itd be one of the most horrible events human history theres a couple ancient population bottlenecks that are worse but you have to look pretty far back  But it would not be even close to a global extinction event
85145,1579180780906901504,This is one of the more recent studies  estimating 60At one point FEMA was estimating only 20 of Americans would die although that number has been criticized That said the most vulnerable regions to famine are those already currently at risk
85146,1579179093857533952,It is not The estimates of the casualties of full global thermonuclear war of all nuclear weapons on Earth are about 5 of the population immediately and 3060 in aftermath  Thats far from all but a few roaches resistant to bug sprayAgain horrific But not extinction
85147,1579178416368390145,several years totaling up to a couple hundred thousand dollars It dried up before Elon left home and again Elon supported himself after he left regardless
85148,1579178228584894464,owned an small emerald mine in ZAMBIA not South Africa Zambia the leading ANTIAPARTHEID state in the region at the time Elons father Errol traded his bushplane for an informal STAKE in the mine He never even saw the mine but regularly received emeralds from it for

85150,1579177484511498241,He started his first company  with his donation of the companys computer his brother donated cash and his friend Greg Couri donated the most  The company sent through several funding rounds  The only time his father ever invested in it was the
85151,1579177291992944641,including picking fruit on a distant relatives farm working as a lumberjack and cleaning out boilers at a sawmill until he was accepted into college with scholarships His mother helped support him in college  he turned the home he was living in into a club on weekends
85152,1579176944582549504,Elon left to put distance from his father who he considered evil as well as to not have to serve in the apartheidenforcing South African military with several thousand dollars to his name and his father mocking his decision to go He supported himself by working odd jobs
85153,1579176654554865664,plural automatically points out that they know literally nothing about him His mother had no assets His father at his peak was worth several million dollars but by the time Elon moved out at age 17 he had already declined significantly  eventually went bankrupt
85154,1579176412463788032,Musk mortgaged everything he had to keep the company alive and the company went through 4 different CEOs before Musk accepted he kept resisting as he was busy with SpaceX2 Musks parents divorced when he was young so anyone who talks about his parents assets in
85155,1579176104459259904,independently wealthy Musk ended up having to fund most of the development Then the board found out that Eberhard had strung them along on a string of lies about timelines and how much things were costing and even the board member appointed by Eberhard voted to eject him
85156,1579175903011442688,Ill just give you the TLDR 1 Musk and Eberhard were both working on the same project creating EVconversion sports cars with ACP technology they decided to merge Elons work into Eberhards empty shell of a company both still in their infancy Despite Eberhard being
85157,1579175544612356096,Neither of the two claims your tweet bought someone elses work and parents apartheid emerald money are true Theyre myths that just wont dieI have a lot of complaints about Musk but said complaints need to be based in reality
85158,1579174026869895168,For that matter whats B supposed to represent Only repression for 25 yearsAnd back to A are we going for the false choice that giving in to nuclear blackmail reduces the odds of nuclear war Because it just promotes more nuclear blackmail  empowers nuclear blackmailers
85159,1579173664595247104,Whats A supposed to represent  Certainly not nuclear warNuclear war would be one of the worst things humanity has experienced in the history of our species comparable to or worse than the Black Death but globally  but is in no way an extinction event
85163,1579140473343836160,Theyre also very focused on reassuring a nervous eastern flank that they WILL protect them in an Article 5 violation even a minor one because Putin constantly tries to probe NATOs willingness to do so incl with hybrid warfare
85164,1579140253491003393,And the general NATO perspective has been the balance between  Dont let Russia  or ANY hostile state  think that they can get away with expansionism or nuclear blackmail esp with partner states  Simultaneously minimize the risk of strategic nuclear exchange
85165,1579139888427204610,Ukraines perspective Keep up whats been working Do whatever is needed to deter Russian nuclear warfare or at least strategic nuclear warfare Try to maintain alliances with the west but even without them dont stop trying to prevent the catastrophe of Russia winning
85166,1579139431155789824,So Putins perspective  Any tools are fair game to try to win but dont take any actions that push the odds of a nuclear exchange too high Keep probing to see how muh I can get away with  Make any deals that will buy time to fortify and rearm for later further conquest
85167,1579139032390328321,While this has no nuclear war risk it bears a lot of domestic risk which will only grow over time But this plays off against the domestic risk of losing the war to a bunch of khokhols
85168,1579138987318738944,The lower risk option for him however is to succeed with conventional warfare hence his desperate move for general mobilization of large numbers of poorly trained underequipped troops
85169,1579138938257944576,If he believes he can use nukes with little to no risk to himself and Russia he will  But if he believes they bear more than a trivial risk of drawing NATO into strategic nuclear warfare he will not
85170,1579138886873546753,Putin understands well the game theory of MAD as an old KGB agent in the Cold War and will probe to see where he can find weakness to nuclear threats  or even usage  without doing actions that he thinks will actually lead to his own destruction
85171,1579138775070158848,remembered for bringing glory to Russia  all of those things being ruined by war with NATO On the other hand a loss to NATO that doesnt result in thermonuclear war is somehow more acceptable than losing to Ukraine NATO is seen as a respectable foe Ukrainians as inferior
85172,1579138696879620096,Present Putins wants to live in luxury and be known and remembered for bringing glory to Russia Putin is now in the situation of people increasingly doubting his leadership He has no desire for war with NATO  again he likes to live in luxury and be known and
85173,1579138544391442433,objection to the expansion of NATO  even commenting in 2002 that he had no objection to Ukraine joining NATO  up until about a decade agoAnd Russias reaction to Finland and Sweden joining NATO was basically Meh
85174,1579138382504296451,strongly wants to join NATO in order to protect it from its invading neighbor when previously it was against NATO membership  just adds more impetus   Putin however sells the NATO reasoning far more to western audiences than to domestic audiences He had little to no
85175,1579138312069341185,Ukrainians are viewed as sort of Russians whose language and culture was corrupted by Poles and this historical mistake can and should be remedied and them brought back into the Russian world The fact that Ukraine also after two rounds of Russian invasions  now
85176,1579138188819714049,Racism is a big problem in Russia and Ukrainians are largely looked down as ignorant rednecks who need to be governed for their own good   Which is part of what makes losing to them so painful to Russia and why they underprepared for this conflict
85177,1579138117961142272,The problem being that Ukrainians were sick of living under corrupt Russian puppets While initially joining NATO was unpopular before Russia repeatedly invaded joining the EU was quite popular This eventually came to a head in the Revolution of Dignity
85178,1579137951334031360,In short Ukraine is a cultural threat to Russia  Ukraine moving to the west presents an alternative claim on the world of the Rus and a free and successful Ukraine would inherently make Russians question their status
85179,1579137884309053440,Ukraine by contrast represents an alternative claim to legitimate heirs to the Rus not only possessing ancient Kyiv but invoking the ancient symbols of their ancestry such as the trident seal of Vladimyr the Great first Grand Prince of the Kyivan Rus
85180,1579137822921220096,its neighboring Rus states as tax collectors for the foreign Golden Horde and then over the centuries parlayed that wealth into hybrid warfare to gain dominion over the other Rus states and rebranded itself as Russia the great empire of all the Rus
85181,1579137766205820928,Losing Ukraine was a particular sore spot not simply because of its large population and great resources but also ideologically   Kyiv was the birthplace of the first great empire of the Rus back when Muscovy was just a backwoods river fort Muscovy gained power over

85185,1579137435875045376,Evaluating Russia mainly means just evaluating the psychology of one person Vladimir Putin However theres a whole culture that he stems from which can basically be summed up as We had greatness but were unfairly robbed from it and we need to restore it
85186,1579137380954820608,High motivation for there to be an effective western deterrent to nuclear action however since they gave up their nuclear weapons in exchange for promises that proved worthless NOT divided between ethnic Russianspeakers more unified than ever before
85187,1579137131263725569,Aware of and concerned about the risk of nuclear warfare particularly strategic  while the west worries about spillover Ukraine would be the direct targets But considering the risks to not outweigh the massive negative assessed consequences of loss
85188,1579137075118768128,Willing to fight on even if they were cut off from the west but even if the US  western Europe did eastern Europe never would as they too fear Russia

85237,1578418019772301312,Expecting perfect phrasing always in offthecuff responses is not realistic What matters is that he talks about pressure and IF Russia uses nukes The word preemptive is awkward in there  I suspect the word he was hunting for is retaliatory
85243,1578359462116458496,Muting this conversation  If you dont know the meaning of the word IF theres no point
85244,1578359304130007041,Ukraine is not a nuclear power and were talking about deploying when there was no war And NATO forces have deployed to conflicts that the USSR  Russia opposed beforeAnd for the LAST BLOODY TIME LEARN THE MEANING OF THE WORD IF
85245,1578358785298821121,But again  and I cant believe I have to repeat this the third time so it better be in all capsLEARN THE MEANING OF THE WORD IF PLEASE
85246,1578358659586793472,And that was before Ukraine started winning and without foresight into what would transpire
85247,1578358228634595328,There have been 23 NATO actions thusfar Deploying troops as peacekeepers to Ukrainian cities would merely have been And your argument is Because not every proposal has been accepted then NATO cant ever do anything despite the fact that they have 23 times
85248,1578357297906319365,Please learn that 1st wordAnd knowing what we know now if people could go back in time I imagine a lot of those who didnt support going in then wish they would have now  There were some calling for it at the time ex Polish FM if I remember right
85249,1578356914609852419,I think what you meant to say is Article 5 is only triggered  NATO doesnt require Article 5 to take military action And the presence of even a single nonnuclear NATO state in Ukraine would be a deterrent out of fear it could escalate into an Article 5 violation
85250,1578356340509900801,Let me repeat my initial tweet  Extra focus on the first word
85251,1578352621290541056,Individual NATO countries certainly could have  Any NATO country would represent a deterrent  A nucleararmed NATO country would represent an excellent deterrent
85272,1578290465182318592,I think were in agreement then  🙂
85273,1578288932667928576,As a nonnative speaker I cant comment on whether there might be some subtlety to Удари that Im not familiar with but for the sake of this argument Im willing to agree with you on that front
85274,1578288738546765825,Seems weve been talking past each other How about this I agree to your point and you agree to mine That he did not call for NATO just going and nuking Russia but that he did mention that the response to Russian nuclear action appears to have been some kind of strikes
85275,1578288439208050688,I dont know anything about Zelenskys staffs response My comments are on the fact that the English translation of his speech thats been circulating is grossly misleading pretending he called for preemptively nuking Russia before the war and again today
85276,1578286655399608322,Im sorry but NATO should make it clear to Russia that the will strike them with a single limited conventional strike if they use nuclear weaponsBut thats a VERY different thing than the misreporting that Zelensky called for NATO to nuke Russia before the 24th
85277,1578285463139651586,And it doesnt even say that the NATO response should be nuclear as again you fully well knowNATO should have preemptively nuked Russia and NATO should make clear itll launch some kind of retaliation if Russia uses nukes are two VERY different things
85278,1578285219693891584,Then you understand very clearly that превентивні ударі що вони знали що з ними буде якщо вони застосовують але навпаки does NOT mean NATO should have nuked them before the 24th to prevent the war as is being promulgated but rather ЯКЩО they use nuclear weapons And only if
85279,1578283799238316033,Continue reading the thread to the point where he ACTUALLY uses Удари in a sentence
85280,1578283554152161280,He did NOT say it IN THE SENTENCE YOURE RESPONDING TO  Ill repeat you CANNOT move words from one sentence into another and then damn a person from the new sentence YOU created  Period  Ever Full stop
85281,1578282091951054848,He does not say Удари in that sentenceYou cant just shuffle words around from one sentence into a different one
85282,1578281624093229056,Where are you getting that president Zelensky Biden is asking to start a nuclear warZelensky is asking that MAD be explicitly spelled out  Which is the single thing that has prevented nuclear war for nearly a century and must be continued in Ukraine
85283,1578280533196701696,You seem to confuse concerns with solutionsEveryone whos paying attention is concerned People like Elon however think you can defuse nuclear threats by giving in to nuclear blackmail when in reality it just creates even more nuclear blackmail  more powerful blackmailers
85284,1578270942844764160,Gotcha politics is always awful but its particularly awful when being used to try to manipulate people with respect to an invasion
85285,1578270798938537990,Basically NATO should make it clear that if Russia uses nuclear weapons theyll be struck back whether by conventional or nuclear strike is not specifiedAll this said it was a quick off the cuff response to a question in an interview for crying out loud people
85286,1578270775076802560,they apply nuclear weapons and not vice versa We need to eliminate the possibility that Russia will use nuclear strikes so if Putin says Ah you want it that way Well here you are Reviewing the use of this pressure is what I think NATO should be doing
85287,1578270729547546624,in reference to the Russian nuclear threat What should NATO do  They unclear who may apply to RussiaRussias nuclear but what is important is I once again appeal to the international community as before 24 February  that preventative strikes would happen to them if
85288,1578270681715859456,have to 100 side with the Ukrainians Im seeing who are saying that this claim that Zelensky called for preemptive nuclear strikes against Russia before the 24th is simply false  Again Im far from a native speaker only just a beginner  But what I get from his speech is
85289,1578270617824268288,To review the application of this pressure  He specifically says тиску pressure Again you cant say that calling for nuclear strikes before the 24th would be pressureTheres an unambiguous IF  Theres unambiguous references to this being a pressure tactic I
85290,1578270493504950272,застосовують but it seems implicit based on the previous linesThe fact that he is talking about pressure tactics and again not nuclear strikes is confirmed when he then saysПереглянути застосування сого тискуTo review useapplication this pressure
85291,1578270310650023936,the case that Russia acts2 There ABSOLUTELY is an IF in there якщо will happen to them IF  Claiming that he said that NATO should have preemptively nuked Russia is simply false3 I put nuclear weapons in brackets because he only says if they useapply
85292,1578270212838739969,I once again appeal to the international community as before the 24th that preventative strikes would happen to them if they apply nuclear weapons and not vice versaSome comments1 He does NOT say preventative NUCLEAR strikes  Only that there would be strikes in
85293,1578270100289122305,превентивні ударі що вони знали що з ними буде якщо вони застосовують але навпакиPreventative strikes whatthat they know that with them will be  would happen to them if they useapply but vice versaSo starting with his previous line
85294,1578270035399053312,Need to apply preventative strikesBut thats not whats said  he transitions straight from his previous line about appealing to the international community як це було до 24го   as it was before the 24th to
85295,1578269971431714817,the conversation is about nuclear pressure the logical assumption would be nuclear pressureWhat about the part that says We need to launch preventive strikes  Well that would start out with something likeТреба наносити превентивні удари
85296,1578269909557006336,Russia threatens nukesWhat should NATO doNATO might apply to Russia nuclear butWhat is however clear is that it does not say nuclear strikes Strikes is удари  this word is simply not there  It goes straight to a pause then але but  Since the rest of
85297,1578269793135706112,this context as the conversation was about what Russia might do but the last line was about what NATO should do  Eg its not clear to me if this isRussia threatens nukesWhat should NATO doRussia might apply Russias nuclear butOr
85298,1578269703604424705,They may applyuse Russia nuclear but what importantI have some ambiguity here that would likely be clear to a more experienced speaker whether росії Russia is in this form referring to to Russia or Russias  Вони they is inherently ambiguous in
85299,1578269606312955904,Що повинна робити НАТОThis is straightforward literallyWhat should to do NATO  What should NATO doThe next is a bit less straightforward to meВони можна застосування росії ядерного але що важливоThis is
85300,1578269501140873216,As a number of Ukrainians have said that this translation is misleading I decided to have a go at it myself Im only a beginner at Ukrainian so Ill caveat this But lets have a goThe conversation leading up was about the nuclear threat posed by Russia Zelensky responds
85302,1578245237155237889,If NATO forces had moved into Ukraine this war wouldnt have happened
85303,1578089084827963392,Oh Im sorry Elon NEVER goes rogue and does stupid things on impulse that cause massive harm to his companies what was I thinking  🙄

85306,1578087828436688896,Or to put it another wayChina has no love for Russia and certainly not for America  They have love only for China  Russia is not a friend  Its just a sometimes useful neighbor One that used to treat it like a colony at that and for which now the tables are turned
85307,1578087523649208320,China is not majorly in favor of Russia  Theyve been trying to play both sides to emerge from this situation as strong as possible
85308,1578087370993311744,In a totalitarian state the media can generally be presumed to be speaking on behalf of the governmentSometimes reporters go rogue but thats the exception not the rule
85309,1578087137316151297,Its a factElon is violating this implicit deal This can have significant repercussions
85310,1578071425776291841,Your friendly reminder that the implicit deal with China is always You get access to our markets you stay out of our politics  Break the deal and get punished severely No exceptionsYou do understand this right And that hes a state media reporter
85311,1578064923669708806,Sure so long as the conditions dont facilitate ethnic cleansing the overthrow of democracies the eradication of languages and cultures etcWhich is a complete nonstarter to Russia right now So there is no basis for itYou dont get to just choose to not be invaded
85312,1578062841755615233,Russians who receive callup orders have choices They can flee many concerned about where Russia was heading left long ago They can hide They can turn their ire on their government They can surrender Ukrainians cannot stop fighting without catastrophe
85313,1578062669327876098,So you prefer ethnic cleansing overthrowing of democracies and strengthening expansionist nuclearblackmailing dictators  economically militarily  politically
85314,1578056575788384259,Putin still has hope that the mobilization will reverse their fortunes and that hell be able to keep a lid on domestic dissatisfaction with it
85315,1578054089669312513,As a general rule countries become more willing to negotiate as they become less confident in their ability to win and more concerned with instability at home caused by the war
85316,1578053626601291777,There is no magical third option that makes the nuclear blackmailing stop  Sorry
85317,1578053293372309510,You choices are1 The deterrent that has functioned for 34ths of a century Or2 Give in to everything Might a well hand over your capitol now
85318,1578052865674936321,Given that Russia hasnt even offered that proposal its impossible to state how Ukraine would react if they did We only know Ukraines bid which is the war ends when theyve retaken all of their country and normal relations are only established after Russia pays reparations
85319,1578048267719417862,Giving in to nuclear blackmail is surely a way to stop people from nuclear blackmailing you in the future and definitely not a way to encourage strengthen and proliferate nuclear blackmailers  🙄

85327,1578003146110033921,Guerrilla resistance to Soviet rule continued for over a decade albeit at increasingly lower levels as the Soviets brutally suppressed it  But the desire for Ukrainians for independence never died just as it hadnt in the centuries of Russian and Polish dominance
85328,1578002835584815105,The remaining Ukrainian forces were routed through a combination of military might and treachery including telling units that if they surrendered their weapons theyd be allowed to go home then killing them inviting leaders to negotiate peace then killing them etc
85329,1578002476695011329,conquered Ukraine to begin with and established an uneasy alliance But the Soviets manipulated the situation to their advantage sending Ukrainian forces into bloody battles against the White Army while preserving their own forces  then turning on them after victory
85330,1578002255852208128,anarchist Ukrainian forces sought to preserve their independence but next door were two warring factions both of whom they worried wished to reengulf them The Soviets convinced Ukrainian forces that the White Army was the real threat after all it was the Tsars who
85331,1578001911982301184,After the end of WWI  with no pressure from Germany anymore  Lenin set his sights on recapturing lost lands Russia was in the heart of the revolution between the Red Army communist and the White Army royalist There were several in Ukraine the largest being the Black Army
85332,1578001615164002304,This is a map of Ukraine in 1919 After centuries of struggle they finally gained their independence To negotiate his way out of WWI Lenin grudgingly ceded Ukraine as an independent state which Germany hoped wrongly would become a proxy state to it
85333,1578001177941270528,The SSRs literally could declare independence and did so when the USSR was weak The USSR was nominally a willing association but constantly under the threat that any counterrevolution leaving would face invasionEvery single oblast in Ukraine voted for independence
85339,1577989284858052608,Except that he is GROSSLY misrepresenting the will of the people and doing so in accordance with Kremlin propagandaThere never was any meaningful Get Annexed By Russia movement in Ukraine  And certainly not now
85340,1577988936726634502,And for the record Part of Regions was NOT a party that wanted to join Russia  They promoted the notion of a balanced eastwest political approach as opposed to Fatherland which was more EUaligned
85346,1577967212987666435,Furthermore even if your country stops providing aid thus giving into nuclear blackmail strengthening the blackmailer both economically and politically and encouraging more nuclear blackmail against you   other countries wont
85347,1577966811353681920,Heres a news flash Ukrainians will continue fighting for their country with or without you and your demands that they submit to the ethnic cleansing of their people and the overthrow of their democracy just like your country would
85348,1577961004964741122,The elements to reducing the risk of nuclear war are1 Not showing that youre afraid to use YOUR nukes and will just roll over when the other party threatens them2 All realistic efforts to reduce the odds of miscommunication misinterpretation and accidents
85349,1577960672624877569,Again the risk is of accidents as neither party is suicidal and both understand well the game theory of MAD Putin was a Cold War KGB agent hes more than familiarAnother key thing to avoiding them is a clearly spelled out nuclear escalation ladder Heres 🇮🇳🇵🇰 s
85350,1577960203999404032,My view is that the only thing that deters nukes is MAD and MAD only works if the other party doesnt think youre just going to back down  But one also needs to reduce the risk of accidents  Hence

85355,1577953313206816769,Looks like the looted theory was correct  A dentist says that they were looted from his house The Russians then used them to scare people during interrogations
85358,1577950405660639233,His solution is give the invader the land that they engaged in a WAR for LAND for thus rewarding their currently faltering land grab and encouraging future land grabs RU already tried to seize much more of Ukraine and failed showing their hand for the future
85359,1577948340616105984,There is no get out of nuclear risk free card  The only thing that reduces your risk from nuclear war is MAD which requires showing a willingness to not back down Because even MAD fails if one party shows a consistent willingness to back down
85360,1577948082150457345,If Putin sees Nuclear threats  Get what I want he will use nuclear threats more often and become increasingly ambitious As will every other despot on the planet Nuclear proliferation will surgeIm sorry if this fact is uncomfortable but it is a fact
85361,1577947797206228993,Hi Im evpassion and its my view that if you make it policy to give terrorists whatever political goals they demand youll be safer from terrorismGiving in to nuclear threats doesnt make the world safer from nukes It just boosts the blackmailer and all other ones

85372,1577774131688390658,Dude its as if you think that giving in to nuclear blackmail discourages rather than encourages itMAD exists for a reason
85373,1577765988040380423,Youre taking a very hostile stance here  Ive consistently pointed out that Im not attacking you and just trying to clear up your viewYou wrote this after I know you saw that post so why do you keep responding like this
85374,1577764320292835338,Im not saying that they didnt If thats what you think is most plausible Ill take your word on it  Theyve been stealing all sorts of stuff  Im sure they wouldnt turn down a big bin of goldIm just telling you where this was found
85375,1577764065044299776,It was a question not an attack  So your view is that they looted a dentists office and stored their loot at the torture centre the same place where they found cages for inmates wires for electric shock a dildo etc etc were found and locals reported screaming
85376,1577762643120734210,So your view is that they looted a dentists office and decided to store their loot at a torture centre where locals reported hearing constant screaming all day
85377,1577761389028032512,Again this isnt the stone age  Training hardware capability and logistics are massive multipliers to manpower That doesnt make manpower irrelevant but its not the dominating factor It doesnt matter if you have a machine gun when the enemy can engage you from 100km
85378,1577760435528470543,The UK provided again among a massive list of other things 7k aircraft 52k tanks including 14th of all Soviet heavy tanks many thousands of other vehicles 2k radar sets 27 naval vessels  hundreds of naval guns  15M pairs of boots  on and on
85379,1577760202870366208,The US delivered to the USSR  among others  over 400k jeeps 12k armoured vehicles incl 7k tanks 114k aircraft  2k locomotives 175m tonnes of food on  on  a total of 175 megatonnes of supplies 35ths of Soviet aviation fuel came from the US 90 of highoctane fuel
85380,1577757757947756552,Despite the fact that Germany was a much smaller nation and was fighting major global industrial powers like the British Empire and the United States at the same time plus resistance armies everywhere  managed by an idiot they STILL probably would have won wo Lend Lease
85381,1577753310169276418,Somewhat higher res in case it helpsWhen the Izyum pocket was taken 18 separate torture chambers were found there This isnt one of them its from a more recently liberated town east of Izyum Pisky Radkivski
85382,1577751919556280334,And also youre apparently not paying attention to the level of equipment going on with the inexperienced mobiks who are being made to personally scrounge together most of their gear And this time theyre not going against rifles but a 21st century military
85383,1577751186148626433,Never mind that their enemy was having to divide their forces to fight multiple industrial powers on other front AND was being personally micromanaged by an idiot who considered himself a military genius
85384,1577750889481355291,You can recognize officers standing in front of a Japanese flag while people from the most populous nation on Earth China bow before them can you notAnd Russia won because the greatest industrial might of the time the US flooded them with Lend Lease
85385,1577750472676589569,And one final note heres the environment you want to have an election in  🤦‍♀️
85386,1577749587149946882,And none of this matters because  and I cannot stress this enough  this is NOT YOUR CALL  YOU dont get to decide whether its worth it for Ukrainians to try to save their democracy and their people from ethnic cleansing THEY DO Theyre the ones sacrificing
85387,1577749061482037276,You cant just spontaneously create trainers and officers out of thin air you have to maintain this during peacetime   Russia didnt  It dismantled this infrastructure in the 1990s to save money And most of their existing officers are needed in Ukraine many dead
85388,1577748765234151455,And to be more specific the situation in modern Russia is worse than that  In both the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union Russia maintained a massive amount of infrastructure for conscription Massive staffed training facilities Tons of officers without soldiers to command
85389,1577748352380420114,Remind me how it went the last time Russia losing a war tried throwing a ton of poorly trained underequipped manpower at the solutionThis isnt 3000 BC Wars arent won by who has the most people for crying out loud Elon
85399,1577577243819245569,The collapse of the Soviet Union greatly reduced the Russian threat for decades There were actually discussions of economically bailing out the USSR at the time Thankfully they didnt happenAbove all we need to stop assuming the best and funding them
85400,1577575746926690310,The biggest mistake we made which didnt put us at any more risk was not being tougher earlier with Putins increasingly dangerous behavior but rather deepening economic ties Which emboldened Putin strengthened him domestically as well as funded  supplied his military
85409,1577474609800159234,As per playing hard boy with every gangster whats your proposal whenever a terrorist makes demands of you give in  The problem is that that creates more terrorism  More  and more emboldened  gangsters
85410,1577474226499428352,And NATO has them And hence has leveragePutin wants glory not ruins He wants to live not commit suicide He wants to live in luxury not eating stale food in a bunker
85411,1577460339901628417,The not giving into blackmail and thus encouraging more blackmail and politicallystrengthening the blackmailer pathSame reason you dont give in to the demands of terrorists
85426,1577281186321534978,As a longrunning Kremlin critic Kasparov is lucky to have not been assassinated yet and his loss would be far less likely to invite repercussions as an assassination of Elon
85428,1577267154117763073,Icelands smelters are usually running below capacity  Should be quite possible to replace
85429,1577266922739052545,Putin Kiev is the mother of Russian cities Ancient Rus is our common source and we cannot live without each other
85430,1577265435179126784,And the crazy thing is Ukraine was neutral in early 2014 when Russia invaded the first time Even after Russia took Crimea they didnt seek NATO membership It was only in the fall during Russian attempts to break off Donbas that they finally decided to do so
85433,1577242461109309440,Kasparov cant go back to Russia out of welljustified fear of arrest torture and worse That youd hold this against him or consider not being able to return to his home country to be less meaningful than Elon giving 13000th of his wealth is absurd
85443,1577224392068980737,The more I look at s poll the other day the more one thing bothers me And its surprisingly not the astoundingly naive hold UN supervised elections brutally militaryoccupied notolerancefordissent ethnicallycleansed territoryIts this
85444,1577210820777619456,Oh but if we give him only PART of the country then hell suddenly not care about the rest Just like in 2014 right  🙄The fact that he already TRIED and failed to take the rest of the country already showed his hand And weve seen that hand before
85445,1577210177417142272,You dont get the choice to not have a war when youre invaded genius Especially when the invaders goal is to overthrow your democracy annex your land and resources ethnic cleanse your people and eliminate your culture and language
85446,1577209786407735296,Yes yes but Elon gave 13000ths of his wealth   🙄Ive given more than 1300th of mine and mine is far less disposable and thats nothing compared to getting arrested and beaten by the police but I guess one cant complain unless theyve given 80M they dont own
85447,1577207220324151297,What have you done besides tweetElon put down Twitter were begging you
85448,1577062353874866179,Ill take People Who Didnt Read The Whole Thread for 800 rubles Alexi
85449,1577061992858537984,Thats not a realistic goal to pursue nor is it at all necessary to change what actually matters preventing the incremental conquest of the west the overthrow of its democracies and the ethnic cleansing of its people
85450,1577060084102070272,The simple equation is Putin cares about places Moscow and St Petersburg a LOT more than he cares about places like Zaporizhzhia and Luhansk Hell never willingly enter into a 5050 bet over them The risk is him miscalculating his risks
85451,1577059704353984512,That doesnt mean it cant happen It can happen from accidents and it can happen from miscalculations for example Putin believing that tactical nuclear war might not escalate into strategic or whatnot The more the tensions the higher the riskBut nobody wants it
85452,1577058920425607168,This is all however a moot point Putin doesnt want nuclear war Hes obsessed with making Russia a great power not a smoldering crater Hes obsessed with life not suicidal Hes obsessed with luxury not gnawing on stale food in a bunker Etc
85453,1577058881100222466,I hate the notion of winnable nuclear war Any fullscale strategic nuclear war would be one of the most catastrophic events in human history But that said one does have to look at the aftermath rather than just assuming everything is gone
85454,1577058830281678849,If we go by the reliability on other Russian missile systems maybe 40 wont even get close to their targets and some will outright impact in Russia  Then subtract warhead reliability from that  Then you have ballistic missile defense systems to attrite the rest
85455,1577058790783926272,If youre in say downtown NYC yeah youre a target in strategic nuclear war  the big cities will be targeted by spread MIRV hits But then theres another issue which is that not every missile reaches its destination
85456,1577058730146877441,So you see people in some town of 60k people thinking theyre going to be a target because they have a national guard depot or something in town sorry youre just not a high enough priority for the limited hardware
85457,1577058669703102464,The warheads costs tens of millions eachDo all those hit cities  No because above all you have to take out your enemys army or theyll conquer whats left of your country And their bases tend to be in remote areas Theres also critical war factories and so forth
85458,1577058611716464641,Some people have this notion that everything thats even slightly a target gets struck in nuclear war Doesnt work that way ICBMs cost like 100M each Russia has under 1k of them Nearly 6k warheads because you MIRV them  some go on shorterrange systems
85459,1577058550332805121,Note this assumes global thermonuclear war but if say India and China stay out of it then their manufacturing and transport infrastructure is largely intact though affected by global supply chains Western powers would retain some nukes as deterrents against them
85460,1577058473367375872,Even that is far overplaying the case For example like 95 of oil production infrastructure would be unscathed 80 of refining infrastructure etc There would be mass disruptions to all supply  transport chains in the first year exceedingly acute But slowly remedied
85463,1577048745320931328,Want to know whether youre on the wrong side of historyJust check to see if youve gotten a Kudos to style tweet from someone as horrid as Dmitry Medvedev praising your cough brilliant idea to hold fair elections in ethnicallycleansed occupied territories
85464,1577045945354579968,This is such an imperialistic notion Sorry Ukraine step aside and let the big boys the countries that actually matter talk this out and decide your future for you You dont get a sayNo Im sorry they DO get a say about their fate and their say is what matters here
85465,1577043163377979393,Let me rephrase your graph
85466,1577041458426613761,in a full USUSSR exchange though was criticized for not digging enough into the aftermath Literallyzeropercent survival is simply not on the tableWere just ignoring for the moment that if theres anything Putin isnt thats suicidal Loves life and luxury  glory
85467,1577041406665031681,Re your deleted tweet about the end of all human life from nuclear warIt cannotNuclear war would be horrific but it cannot produce extinction Its dubious that even a doomsday device such as a gigantic salted cobalt bomb could FEMA estimated 80 survival
85468,1577038672062746624,First off longer time scale  How long do you think hes going to waitSecondly hes not going to just hand power down to a peacenik  This is  again  delusional thinking His entire inner circle is people like him
85469,1577037907113566208,ED 25 million Ukrainians deported to Russia as of September
85470,1577037491257081856,And this is the conditions in which Elon wants to have a UN supervised election  The level of naivete is quite simply appalling
85471,1577037360901914626,Between fleeing killings torture and deportation Russia eliminates almost all potential resistance They then repopulate the areas with people from Russia And everyone who lives there knows the brutal consequences of doing anything to resist  how youre always monitored
85472,1577037111290523648,The vast majority of most cities that had time to evacuate fled before Russia got there sadly many like Mariupol did not have time  mostly the elderly remaining Then in the areas taken by Russia 2 million Ukrainians were deported to Russia
85473,1577036785963929601,The first thing Russia did when they moved into places like Bucha was demand to see peoples cell phones and look for evidence in their homes that might suggest that they might fight back against Russian rule These problematic people are then cleansed
85474,1577036137427632128,ED Misremembered the numbers Opposition Platform had a higher  of people than the general population willing to volunteer for the army Including volunteer battalions  noncombat assistance 25ths were willing to volunteer in some way while 25ths insisted it wouldnt happen
85475,1577035608492748800,This notion is mindbogglingly naive
85476,1577035273338523649,The calculus is exactly the same  If your solution to Putin saying nukes is to give him whatever hes asking for at the moment go ahead and save yourself the time and give him Berlin and Alaska
85477,1577033052009947137,And to be more specific in this war Russia started out trying to capture the whole country thus already tipping their hand as to what their goal was The fact that Russia failed at this was no thanks to those who said to abandon Ukraine
85478,1577032581220294656,No no clearly a fair election is going to be held under Russian military occupation w no intimidation cleansing of the opposition or recolonization including the extensive amounts that already happened  theyd totally abide by a result that goes against them anyway 🙄
85479,1577029793811292160,Might as well throw this out here too while Im at it  On each regions pie chart green is Zelenskys share of the vote at the last election while reds is PoroshenkosBecause unlike Russia Ukraine has an actual democracy
85480,1577029073171206145,The world can be a really dangerous place  thats a scary thing But if your reaction to fear is to give your bully whatever theyre demanding theyre going to keep exploiting that of you  growing ever more powerful in the processYou must stand up The sooner the better
85481,1577028214412955648,I cannot stress this enough
85482,1577028076177088513,Compared to the general UA population 82 were prepared to join the armed forces 143 to join volunteer forces  252 to provide noncombat assistance 18 planned to just try to survive 3 to flee 14 didnt believe itll ever happen  182 unsure
85483,1577027769984503808,If Russia were to invade the proRussian Opposition Platform  For Life said 73 would join the armed forces 27 to volunteer brigades 315 would provide noncombat assistance for a total of 415 and 121 unsure 43 said they didnt believe itll ever happen
85484,1577026622804594688,A country that rigs its elections is NOT going to allow fair elections  What it will do is gladly PRETEND to allow fair elections in order to buy itself some time wherein it will continue its process of cleansing or cowing any opposition from the territory and recolonizing it
85485,1577026341161295873,Because its appallingly naive to think that you can ever get a fair vote in a Russianoccupied territory  It cannot be repeated enough There Is No Civil War In Ukraine  Russia MADE UP this Ukrainian Civil War concept  And can do it in literally any country
85486,1577026020552896512,The only political party to support any concessions to Russia to prevent war was the aforementioned small proRussian Opposition Platform  For Life And even there the only concession supported is to not join NATO and only 503  Even THEY flatly rule out all else
85487,1577025545014951936,This was before the war  the Ukrainian public has shifted strongly more antiRussian since then But some examples
85488,1577024403589967873,Again if he threatens nuclear bombs now and you give him what he wants then hes going to threaten nuclear bombs a couple years from now to get even more And again and again and againSo whats the point of giving him tens of millions of people  resources for nothing
85489,1577023052990201856,By region support for wanting to become part of the EU  Note the areas being annexed
85490,1577022878817533958,3 of Ukrainians want Ukraine to be even in the Russian customs union let alone ruled by Russia
85491,1577022453800669184,Dark blue strong proUkrainian dark red strong proRussian The last two bars are south and east respectively  the areas Russia is trying to annex at present after their attempt to annex all of Ukraine failed
85492,1577021987511185408,The fact that youre also taking the proethniccleansing and prooverthrowingdemocracy position by allowing Russia to conquer its neighbors also does not go unnoticed either
85493,1577021734640680961,To think that Putin is just going to stop at Ukraine when he and his supporters continuously talking about annexing everything up to Berlin and Alaska is beyond naive  As naive as believing that Hitler would stop once he got Austria I mean the Sudentenland I mean W Poland
85494,1577021340028047360,Youre not taking the overall less risk position Youre taking the reduced shortterm risk greater longterm risk position by showing dictators that you can get anything you want by threatening nukes  allowing them to annex tens of millions of people  vast resources
85495,1577021087635845120,Elon there Was No Independence Movement In these places  Even the most proRussian major party in Ukraine Opposition Platform  For Life did not even remotely support joining Russia and most of its members polled said theyd volunteer for Ukraine if RU invadedPolls
85496,1577018552380313600,And heres a member of the Duma Anna Kuvychko from Putins party leading children in a song where they sing we will return Alaska to the haven of the motherland In the full version the children sing theyre willing to die for Putin Uncle Vova
85497,1577017587791077376,Before you answer heres the speaker of the Duma threatening to seize Alaska
85498,1577013388768870400,1 If you think elections can be held under Russian  auspices then youre become awfully gullible
85499,1577011135441608704,Lets try this then the will of the people in Alaska  AFTER Russia invades scaring off or cleansing anyone whos not proRussian or willing to support Russia for moneypower  should be determined by a Russian sham election carried out by armed people knocking on your door

86473,1574544236175069185,I totally agree Twitter has major issues
86476,1577503964194832385,They wont be as efficient as a finelytuned 7axis at any single task but they could open the door to a new wave of task automation Especially outside the Tesla factory
86483,1569875563036442624,When  comments on your tweet and now you got 20 followers
86484,1569339557715361792,We need a sweet train model
86629,1580044824933453824,Well sorry we trust him more than you
86680,1579489842655698944,Vladimir Ilich Lenin — You probe with bayonets if you find mush you push If you find steel you withdrawThis has been the Russian way long before Lenin and its still the doctrine they live by
86700,1579335983677349891,So how about that an eye for an eye bull now   attacks a military target and as a revenge  is ready to bomb the energy infrastructure
86718,1579124635614212096,I guess you dont know that much about situation in Ukraine
86719,1579123244082561024,They were not killing Russian speaking people They were fighting little green men planted by Russians Wagner and conscripts of Russian army
86721,1579104395475976193,Musk would have told him not to fight for rights of the colored That would just mean more violence and suffering
86724,1579100514184482817,So you think  will stop when  stops fighting back That would just allow Russia to go forward with planned Im a Finn I know what Russia is about
86813,1577887785373106176,Please stop You are making a fool of yourself now And a puppet for Kreml
86900,1576995071735394304,Russia will collapse before such a vote can be arranged
86901,1576989531634401280,Also I think Russia will collapse way before they could have any vote
86905,1576976548510302211,They already had the vote when soviet union broke There are other methods than just creating a fake referendum to fake a voteBut sure after this there arent many people who would want to join Russia anymore
86906,1576973554243211264,Why give Starlink in the first place then
86907,1576972588479549440,No That would mute so many international rules and would give Putin a win A win he doesnt deserve
88287,1576126415065403392,Thank u for keeping ur word on this matter
88972,1578150240439312385,Thanks I really appreciate that I know the feeling but try not to be Every image including mine has its issues and could be better Grass is always greener on the other side of the fence

89027,1573035161708478464,this is so insanely good
90433,1580305237075640320,Well… at least youre being honest

90444,1579972671198355457,100…You really need cash that bad huh

90525,1575621936763191296,Elon threw a tantrum impulsively decided to take TWTR private and the board surprisingly accepted the offerHe then almost immediately after regretted it and the market tanked Now hes about to be forced to buy it against his will Incredible
90526,1575608195132772352,“Im ride or die brother… Id jump on a grenade for you”   to  My god… these texts are pathetic
90528,1575515161464807424,TSLA stock price falling before  is forced to buy TWTR Elon “Hurry Tweet something crazy to pump it back up”
90557,1573676545817907201,To be fair  TSLA has been one of the biggest beneficiaries from the Feds wreckless policy for the past decade and last 2 years specificallyZero rates and QE is what helped Tesla succeed and allowed your stock to get to such an absurd valuation
90618,1570114355060002817,TSLA call buying is nuts… dumping more soon

107771,1579678934852960256,its fixed in 2022362
107779,1579523307430612992,The graphic has been gone for a while not sure why but it can still see them not that it always does
107780,1579518512280002560,Ive seen it on 106923 already
107781,1579505660013989890,It has detected speed bumps for a long time Some it will miss tho especially if theyre hard to see
107784,1579288345594646528,I havent gotten a notification for an Elon tweet in months Ive turned it off and on again Works for other accounts with notifications on

107818,1578485064127561728,Any more info on highway betasingle stack I know the team is working hard on it just curious
107853,1578383219128516612,Not exactly Again he can sell for 50 per share guaranteed today or take a small risk for an extra 4 per share Probably just playing it safe
107854,1578383085065981952,But theres so much mroe he could tell us D weve only seen a 2 year old prototype
107855,1578382875799453696,I mean thatd be good too
107856,1578382529836589056,50 guaranteed today is better than maybe 54 later

107904,1578063831024164866,Thats its secret It was never working
107909,1578053606577774593,Oh yeah I think its just because that car was a bit close If they werent there I dont think it would have done that
107911,1578051914507370496,Alright ya got me beat you can turn the grid back on jeeze 🙄
107913,1578036587618705408,I dont interact with my school busses but mine stopped yesterday for one in that same situation
107914,1578029200107134976,🔥 Awesome Yeah I love the yoke
107915,1578027316479135746,In the linked video I covered the USS so they thought an object was in the way and beta worked fine So I dont believe it uses them in decision making Otherwise it wouldnt have moved
107916,1578027047263567873,Lol yeah been like that for a while
107918,1578024465279373312,Did it happen in this video Ha didnt notice
107919,1578012738525483009,Great decision making here by  Thinks about passing cyclist but sees car approaching and decides to follow safelyFull video 👉
107920,1578011707720568832,As I show at the end of this video  I dont think beta uses USS for decision making
107921,1578006458603560961,Tight fit but  106923 handles it wellFull video 👉
107923,1577873785998434306,Its not even comparable Huge difference
107924,1577856620805165056,Not really Sometimes i have a bad experience with updates
107925,1577856305980706817,In the morning 8am est

107934,1577836554567008257,It was new with 1069
107935,1577836374283141121,Are you using FSD Beta
107936,1577836350337859584,I cant imagine itll still have the inches maybe Im wrong but I think the little bumper graphic will still be accurate enough Well have to see
107939,1577762279159906304,Seems to be what Tesla alludes to and would prove them right in not needing lidar
107940,1577762114617360385,It represents any piece of the environment where the car cannot drive because something is there Its a type of general solution to drivable space without having to know exactly what every object is
107944,1577756143752970242,Itll only get better  I remember when auto lane change was first added it would bail on the lane change probably 30 of the time Youd be more than half way into the new lane and the car would nope out of there so fast for no reason lol
107945,1577755930829197323,They can be anything but in this picture specifically it was a barricaded area with I believe some outdoor seating i cant remember exactly what was there
107952,1577750635881152532,Tomorrow morning D should I quit my job so I can put up vids faster lolol
107954,1577746569352421376,Theyre very good You can see a bit behind the truck on the right And there was another truck later in the drive with a ramp coming out of the back and it was occupancy network displayed
107955,1577744546670288896,So it will start to move through Weird I mean not that Ive never seen that mistake but its not something I can say Ive seen in a long time
107956,1577743945135800337,I have the footage on my gopro ill attach a pic of out the window while editing tonight
107957,1577742960321511424,it was all there it was crazy

107981,1577624594634137600,If your software number is lower then its possible
107994,1577503317072416769,And radar is still max85 and follow distance min is 2 I still think vision only is better overall If the problem was already solved the cars wouldnt be delivered with missing features Theres also a blindspot in the front of the car as shown by
107995,1577501170716839936,Of course I dont I trust the engineers will get this to work but I dont think it will be as accurate as USS in all scenarios
107996,1577500368795496448,The fact is the car has blind spots I dont think the current camera set up is enough to fully replace USS for all instances Maybe 99 of the time it wont matter tho
107997,1577499499597103106,For 3 days while parked lol
107998,1577499299373629443,Most toxic misinformed angry bot in existence
108000,1577493836049551368,I think uss are already off for beta
108001,1577491719930740737,I mean if you hit something with USS its your fault too P
108002,1577490460272099329,Not really actually lol
108003,1577490415590195200,Yeah thats why its on the roof for stuff above the car for the FWD and there are USS inside the FWD to detect side objects like cars
108004,1577486348436606976,How many bits is uss
108006,1577462071574220800,I thought those were already getting hit even with the USS
108007,1577455162083495936,The car will remember youre in a parking garage 😲
108008,1577454404227452928,Model X roof and door USS going away
108009,1577447113549643779,I mean sometimes crutches are nice
108010,1577445087025455105,Got this when I tried to like your tweet 😳
108011,1577434960054865921,I have no idea what this means D
108013,1577399143332425728,USS only work at a very short distance and slow speed
108015,1577393911944953856,I mean if the sensor is 1 I bet its more and theres 12car thats 12x 450k cars thats 54m immediately not to mention time saved installing not having to repairreplace them in the future etc
108016,1577393226503397378,This is how pretty much every update to AutopilotFSD has gone It starts out slightly worse but then catches upsurpasses the old ability
108018,1577388990470230018,Today we are taking the next step in Tesla Vision by removing ultrasonic sensors USS from Model 3 and Model YWow This was a big question for me I find this even more wild than radar removal Cant wait to see how it performs
108020,1577372056525877248,Na Gary confirmed he cannot sell right now
108021,1577369659111870464,Unless he does need to sell more Tesla then dont do it lol
108023,1577362925186072590,I mean that depends on the mount This mount is after market Fastest winds weve had since install is I think 60mph which is pretty crazy for here and it was fine
108024,1577353546323869704,It does its best work alone lol
108029,1577342063925927937,Im paying and its worth it for us Only had a cellular hotspot before
108030,1577338880025628674,GameStop up almost 10 on the news  is buying Twitter gme tsla twtr
108036,1577332201141698560,I wish lol I rarely see above 120 these days
108040,1577287219249053696,So I set it up before the leaves came last fall and it was good all winter When the leaves came in I had 15min of obstructions even after cutting some trees Now Im down to less than 1min of obstructions
108041,1577286183737905152,I usually get around 80100Mbps down
108042,1577286074040143872,It wont be as stable i can game for several hours and get only 13 disconnects during that time And they usually only last a few seconds or less than a second I would keep comcast tho honestly
108044,1577137194807877632,I think the other systems eye tracking is more advanced than what Tesla has but maybe Im wrong
108047,1577135884683857920,Hands arent going anywhere imo
108049,1577132441349025792,Eh thats a bug to fix This is a poll of cool new things we want
108051,1577131561438564352,I know what the people want
108053,1577085230640340992,I think the yoke should be optional but Id pick it I way prefer it now
108057,1577012319774646273,Here ya go watch it 100 times P
108058,1577011977972375553,Its on tik tok lol adding it to shorts in a minute
108060,1576998768272371712,What do you mean lol
108061,1576998070130122753,Hands on the wheel then P
108063,1576996968681070593,What should the view be of how it should be done that would allow it to be here already
108064,1576996391095713793,What Im saying is if the product isnt good enough it will be a failure So that will be Teslas motivation to fix these complaints As of now the  of people that buy FSD is tiny If Tesla wants more people to buysubscribe they will need to make it better
108065,1576995515836702721,Im not sure what this has to do with what we were talking about
108066,1576993458182852608,Gates are one thing but Im not sure its great at placing floating objects like this arm
108067,1576993273729912837,A publicly traded company wants to make the most profit possible
108068,1576993143232565248,I mean thats an argument for every product ever I dont like iPhones so i dont buy or use them
108070,1576980562467700742,There can only be one
108071,1576980297211871234,Not a good time for the market this entire year Its a good company Itll come back
108072,1576979337701896192,It works pretty well
108073,1576978831885287435,This is what I want next in
108074,1576933008577552386,It had a max of 15 but I set it between 6 and 8 you can see on the screen
108075,1576930183357296640,FSDBeta in a parking garage 🤯 worked really well
108076,1576907172750905344,The point is safety is the number one concern and its not finished This is an optional product that people dont have to use if they dont want Even if it rolls out in full Robo taxi if its not comfortable people just wont use the service
108077,1576888361737854976,Glad to hear snow and safety critical intervention So for the picky out there that take over often Tesla knows the difference between critical and comfort interventions
108079,1576712169529708545,What will this tunnel be used for
108084,1576624460135735296,Must be exhausting to constantly want to be negative about something
108088,1576612535268098050,Pretty much this  but I use a hero 10 now Still use the Insta360 in the same spot tho
108091,1576583443143569409,When I was a kid in the trailer park I couldnt believe the expensive ass cars people had lol I mean maybe not expensive compared to an X but our car was like 3k and they had like brand new mustangs and huge suvs lol
108092,1576580803185631234,If you use a straw or something to put next to the teeth you can loosen it so you dont have to cut it I just didnt tighten it much so 8 could slide it off
108095,1576393270585761793,The videos were really impressive I wish they would release them Maybe theyre out there somewhere
108096,1576392765092425728,They had the dojo chipscabinets on display parts of the self driving hardware videos of accident avoidance tests I had never seen etc
108097,1576384306192056320,No clown in that clip
108099,1576381300079894528,Dont think Id go that far 🤣
108102,1576366393288667141,Which specific tasks would you like to see it handle first
108104,1576362756990590977,Like many items I dont think it would make money in a residential situation Just add to your free time kinda like a roomba
108105,1576358313284935680,Im saying the worst case scenario is it replaces a minimum wage job and takes 2 years or less to pay off A better case is what you said
108106,1576357838263185408,Dreamin Why not Add 5 years of inflation to these numbers and its the same idea
108107,1576353045922709507,Yep It could be a doorman bot at a hotel Could stay plugged in and open the door and greet people all day and night
108108,1576352367276007424,Just easiest to always assume the worst case scenario of replacing a minimum wage job
108110,1576350986737618946,I was just thinking if you can get this bot to even do one simple task it pays itself off in 2 years or less Imagine it does 2 simple tasks And it can do those 20 hours a day assuming a 4 hour chargeGet the newest model every 2 years like a phone
108115,1576330612687839232,Well they didnt give much timeline for this
108116,1576330517644918784,Yeah that helps a lot
108118,1576307251526000640,One of my favorite pieces is Musk did not over sell this at all He repeatedly warned people to temper their expectations which allowed me to be very happy with the reveal
108125,1576246752415404033,Itll pick him up and throw him across the street
108126,1576246507363147778,Yeah it was only for some of the tech demos they had there that were behind plexi glass and guarded to make sure you didnt take pics Cybertruck isnt new
108130,1576238909805105152,Yeah sry it didnt go for very long so I missed it

109729,1570304802458046464,Were not even into the original delivery windows for Model Y in Australia Nov  Feb so not sure how you make that determination
109730,1570265139517206529,We were spending somewhere between 18002000 on petrol per year that is expected to be around 13 in electricity so around 620 Then we eliminate around 3500 of servicing costs per year We do have the road user charges in VIC
109731,1570235367550484481,Definitely very cool feeling We work hard to achieve a goal like this and only with prioritisation lean spending in other areas could we do this
109732,1570224836240379905,Its a really nice place to live Double the size half the price of living in the city

109745,1569431889769005059,Yeah Im not talking tomorrow but over the next 510years
109746,1569420529802838016,Many dont understand owning an ICE vehicle is like playing an expensive game of hot potato once consumer demand shifts at scale theres no guarantees of resale value
109748,1569142771260477440,got a count of how close we are to billions of miles
109751,1569067261914398720,Even with 2x Teslas Im not going to get close to using this
109752,1569009672522444800,Also possible but trajectory mapping should have understood that were not at risk of being in front of the vehicle Both seem too early in context of the occupancy network

109754,1568876161786322944,No idea but know theres quite a few waiting hopefully not too much longer Fremont is ramping Q4 maybe Q1 surely
109757,1568841064114712576,What software version you running
109762,1568825073884332032,Nope this is beta related

109790,1568417318753148928,A connected car opens the door to features like this being possible Not sure whats difficult to understand about that
109792,1568413388908417024,Sim card in vehicle aka connected car refer to original tweet
109794,1568411920490971138,Someones not paying attention
109795,1568406708753661953,Dont see a technical reason why it wouldnt work What software version are you on
109796,1568406138550616064,Go read the tweet again
109797,1568405927044456449,So if Tesla offers it on all 4 models soon to be 5 and 6 and sells millions and another manufacturer makes 25 models and offers it on 2 or 3 that sell tens of thousands of units which is more important
109799,1568404291672768512,All models vs select few is the important take away there
109800,1568394083324010496,Im betting in 1qtr theres going to be more dual Tesla families than exist for all others with compatible cars combined
109801,1568393927748911105,Glad to hear it but how many garages in Aus you think have 2 compatible cars where owners regularly going between them and having their settings follow would be of use
109802,1568392688466284544,Tesla is doing this with every model
109803,1568392540109570048,If a car has been doing it for ages it would have 4G connectivity aka a smart car
109805,1568345970487996416,The first stage booster supporting this mission previously launched Crew Demo2 ANASISII CRS21 Transporter1 Transporter3 and eight Starlink missions  that reusability completely changed the game
109811,1568152967324499969,Twitter is the wrong place for you if youre seeking perfect gramma My comment was connected car vs not Theres about to be a hole bunch of people with 2x Teslas in the garage not sure how many have 2x of that specific model of BMW
109821,1568047115896758274,Australia could certainly contribute some surface area solar farms and gridscale storage is happening just not fast enough legacy power generation is aging out soon
109823,1568030487368826881,Cloud profiles on Teslas is a really nice addition stretching their legs from legacy auto dumb cars Only possible with a connected car

110288,1567976669184507904,The Spice Must Flow
110799,1580611860688097281,Thatd explain it Looks like a new version which will be eligible for your vehicle should be releasing next weekJust a bit more patience and youll be there 🙌
110802,1580425202671837185,Hey Jason did you drive at least 100 autopilot miles within the last 30 days and have remained on a 202220 update
110806,1579922803481923584,Our first drive was taking delivery of our Model 3 Performance in 2018 We had never driven a Tesla prior but knew it was the oneHave never regretted that decision for a moment 🙌
110810,1579683426059563008,Yes Much needed fix were glad to see is finally out Any version that is 361 and newer will include it
110812,1579678917887426561,Didnt see a comment yet so yes it should in fact fix the whine 🙌
110821,1578646079675170816,Kind of so that API call was introduced earlier this year and then got removed just a couple months ago unexpectedly check  for this imageIt seems Tesla just went with a hybrid approach where some data is cached while some isnt May have caused issues
110822,1578636800616124416,This changed a few months ago requires a specific software update  mobile app update and their servers now store the last value and can be accessed via the APIsThats why you can see the 7 hours ago below each value 👍
110828,1578530434345902080,Further we have conversations frequently with Tesla employees who relay information to usWe only share what weve been allowed to typically once it has already been shared to at least one vehicle owner via service appointments
110829,1578529935009800192,This doesnt seem unspecificYou can always search on Twitter by using “fromelonmusk 10693” before you claim weve been misleading
110838,1578330475529019394,How about we see before you cast doubt
110843,1578187820849451009,Seems to be impacting many
110844,1578185908200689664,Yes 👍 As communicated by the website
110845,1578185123907850242,Yeah seems to be a major bug 🤖
110846,1578184778276171776,Its happening to anyone with Twitter Blue as far as we can tell but if not impacting a ton of people
110847,1578177426785378304,No company would purchase these if they could only tow 11000lbs Jason No reason to be delusional
110851,1578175889971421184,This is very good information Thank you Andres
110853,1578174621223776257,Yeah AFAIK since it is primarily B2B it is planned to be private deliveries as to also allow for scheduled walkthrough and employee educationIf Tesla is hosting an event this would ultimately be up to Pepsi and any other parties 👍
110854,1578174096138903552,Were curious about this as well Not intending to invalidate any interest in the Semi for everyone else and would love for new information to be shared Just noting what weve been told so far 💙
110855,1578173470000627712,As far as weve been told since we have a friend who reserved a single Semi deliveries are happening privatelyA majority of all deliveries are happening B2B not to usual customers The last update they got around March was theyd be contacted to coordinate their delivery
110856,1578172818851655680,The Semi had its event about four years ago and the specs havent changed so no additional livestream nor inperson event is planned Deliveries will happen privately starting with Pepsi
110857,1578172241719660544,500mi estimated range fully loaded with 82000lbs gross combination weight
110858,1578171952975396864,The event already happened 👍
110861,1578164949183971328,That “bends” area is fun to drive through It is amazing how well Full SelfDriving Beta handles it 👍
110883,1577614146622746627,To answer this is to go in circles and spur more conflicts with others so if youd like to discuss this more feel free to send us a DMFor personal reasons just rather not discuss this publically any further Thank you for your understanding
110884,1577611541364412417,There have been thousands of instances where autopilot will experience a panic state whether from software or hardware it doesnt matter and will disable itself requiring resuming immediate control of the vehicle for safetyThis has to be solved before robotaxi 👍
110885,1577609614203359232,Permanent SoC failure has never happened as far as we knowTesla has a dedicated Silicon Hardware Testing program that validates the current and future chips before they make their way into customer vehicles
110886,1577600720777359360,Hell yeah Enjoy the update 🙌
110887,1577598053514547200,Itll be waiting for you when you return As will we for your review of it 🙌
110902,1577539080786624514,Good things coming in the near future for everyone All that matters
110903,1577537275990155264,Its a stern response yes Everyone is entitled to their opinion and we appreciate any that are shared However we dont believe fact denial or misinformation being spread benefits the community
110904,1577529470918922240,Its clear that youre unwilling to change how you feel so its pointless for additional energy to be wasted on itHW3 continues on Software is king Life goes on
110905,1577528324552724480,Look if you want to continue to proliferate bad information to your followers were clearly powerless to stop you Youve demonstrated thisYouve been given direct quotes employee opinions and those with direct access to the underlying systems disagreeing with your stance
110906,1577527601572114432,He doesnt mean anything He literally said the vehicle would continue driving if one chip fails A direct quoteNo “car will pull over” nor “its okay if it fails and you have to take over on this ADAS system” He simply stated HW3 could accomplish this It has not
110907,1577526847918600198,Glad that they changed their mind on this then
110908,1577523558846119936,They can if you use a validation network which was its own slide on Autonomy Day No longer utilized in the same way or at all
110909,1577522435263328256,3M cars are not on Full SelfDriving Beta or its stack yet
110910,1577522141448151041,This is a silly conversation at this point
110911,1577522086175592450,If it aborts and drives someone off the road or causes a collision it doesnt matter what caused it Period
110912,1577521957502754816,Nobody is saying hardware failure 😔
110913,1577521807631867905,If it can improve over time with software or hardware thats all that matters
110914,1577521651872239617,Its not overblown its just because that was what Elon himself communicated Which seems to be a widely contested sentiment which is silly
110915,1577521403670106113,It has happened to a handful of individuals within this thread at least once and to us twice Collectively it happens dozens of times a day if not more across the fleet
110916,1577516053386604544,Were excited for when this comes to fruitionHowever for the time being the failure of one SoC results in the vehicle disabling autopilot and requiring immediate control Until this changes whether with software or hardware it can not be driverlessSeems reasonable
110920,1577493721935118336,If thats the case just a little bit longer of waiting 😢 Weve seen a good handful of reportstweets of new invites being received this morning who were on 209Fingers crossed 🤞
110923,1577491287330070528,Have you driven 100 miles on autopilot within the last 30 days 🥺
110941,1576792886544195584,This was directly said by Elon during Autonomy Day “If one Tesla Full SelfDriving chip fails the car will keep driving”
110942,1576787208899420160,were in agreement btw  just to clarify
110943,1576787036362506240,One of our main points is this tweet  from Elon where he mentions HW3 has full failover redundancyBy definition this is not the case If one chip experiences an unrecoverable error and crashes autopilot enters a panic state and is deactivated
110944,1576773584701181952,My fiancée said to me “Stop being mean to Omar” 💀
110945,1576769797529796608,Stop with what nonsense Weve stated constantly that we personally believe a retrofit is not only possible but would be free of chargeBoth of which are supported by Elons tweets youve embeddedJust trying to understand what you mean by that
110946,1576766916793729024,It should be considered significant that there was no mention to HW4  new hardware being required for Full SelfDriving at Fridays eventOne employee has stated that it is still very much an active project and while approaching its final design is far from completion 👍
110947,1576765752668876800,Were holding out hope on a retrofit being available for vehicles utilizing RobotaxiNo direct confirmations from Tesla about this obviously but the conversations weve had with employees align with this as a possibility A lot of focus is going into efficiency  cost savings
110948,1576758458367414275,This is planned to be included in the next generation hardware for this sole reason 👍
110954,1576737471177445377,Any sense of full failover redudnancy would have prevented this as we directly quoted Elon from Autonomy Day one chip can fail and the car should keep driving without issueWhile very uncommon these unrecoverable states happen from time to time
110955,1576737035754254336,Among friends unsure if they have shared such publicly youre aware of at least one instance of autopilot failing an unrecoverable state the red steering wheel panic state occurring and their vehicle almost drove them off the roadHandsonthewheel prevented this
110956,1576736350409138176,Full failover redundancy by definition implies the other chip can take over operations in the event of an unrecoverable state and continue without any noticeable change from the original stateAgain this never happened and is still untrue today
110957,1576735114960130048,This should be very possible especially with the continuous iterations and improvements Tesla has been making upon the new stack
110958,1576734568467398657,Not in disagreement with that at all Theres plenty of room on both SoCs to include processes that can safely take over and move to the side of the road upon an unrecoverable stateHowever this has yet to happen When it does it will be fantastic for everyone alike
110959,1576734159443152897,Yeah hardware failures would be very very bad Weve yet to hear of a single Full SelfDriving Computer HW3 ever actually experience a hardware failure or otherwise need to be replaced Any failures are always software
110960,1576733425385381888,And said failures better to refer to as an unrecoverable state will cause autopilot to enter panic state and require immediate control over the vehicleTheres no doubt that theres wiggle room left in the SoCs especially with recent changes but the initial plan is void
110961,1576733039735885824,The complete copy was at least what was last communicated by TeslaElon during Autonomy Day which has now been updated to us publicly as of Fridays eventChip failure is rare but as you know it has happened to many of us at least once including some original testers
110962,1576732240179888128,The MCU can crash and reboot and especially years ago this would happen pretty frequently including to our vehicle however this has no impact whatsoever on autonomyautopilotThe autopilot computer continues on just fine even while the MCU reboots itself fully 👍
110963,1576731388815953920,This was indeed the original intent and what was communicated at Autonomy Day The goal as stated by Elon was if either chip fails the other could continue driving the carThis was never true in practice It is very uncommon for the chips to fail but it does happen
110964,1576730882882162688,For all intents and purposes it is illadvised to refer to some functions being run across two different chips as redundancy especially when they lack stabilitystate resets today if a chip experiences a fault it will enter panic mode and red steering wheel error
110965,1576730183586828288,Every single employee weve spoken to across different roles at Tesla past and present has stated that redundancy was not possible This is not intended to be a stab at Tesla as they try their best and pivot quickly which is fantastic and should be applauded
110966,1576729699945918464,There is a tremendous amount of redundancy and overlap in both our data acquisition and data monitoring capabilities here This never came to fruition It was ditched for performance benefits b4 this ever occurred on any vehicles on the road Please stop rewriting history 😢
110967,1576729107722694656,This is false The general principle is that any part of this could fail and the car will still keep driving One chip fails car keeps driving – ElonOnce we have a plan the two machines exchange their independent version of the plan to make sure it is the same
110969,1576720757589090304,From one of Teslas Hardware Silicon Validation Team Leads in Fremont
110970,1576422690331631616,We assume by default that most who are replying negatively and dont follow this account are Q SadlyGot a lot of that yesterday
110973,1576115904923856896,What part did you find embarrassing Wed love for you to elaborate on this
110985,1576051111475019776,Wow is an understatement
110996,1576029434787700737,Very impressed by the various demonstrations at WRC 2022 This doesnt change how impressed we feel by what has been shown so far tonightMost demonstrations are at least 23 years of development many 56 years
110997,1576026577543974912,Have we discussed anything about that topic NoWe merely stated a FACT of this being less than a years progress and you responded to it with denial We dont interact with factreality deniersCheers 👍
110999,1576024225151754241,It took them over ten years to get as far as they have This is in under a year
111004,1576011244275830784,And youre in one yourself Good one 👍
111005,1575984451032518657,Sorry should have realized you were Q long ago and not wasted our time Our mistake 👍Have a good one
111014,1575942429215113217,But there will still be some updates and news regarding Full SelfDriving and vehicles so a good amount of info for everyone
111015,1575942104936697856,For anyone within the robotics generalized engineering or machine learning industries what is shared tonight in terms of progress from one year ago will be mindblowingIf you dont typically find IntelNvidia conferences interesting it will just sound neat overall 👍
111016,1575941019438264320,How early on did you reserve your CybertruckMass production begins soon and deliveries should be Q3Q4 next year if not far sooner
111017,1575940331182309376,It will still be several years weve seen projections of 20262028 before we see any production builds of their robotics available for purchase Most voices weve seen are understanding of this 👍
111018,1575939846618509313,Tesla more than any other company in recent history has made monumentous leaps in terms of mass production which has helped them grow at the rate they arehaveAnyone can make a oneoff or a limited batch but we believe if anyone can massproduce robots it would be Tesla
111019,1575931649384058880,Humanoid is essential to the acceptance of robotics in everyday society This is based on the opinions of the majority and will also make for a happier future assuming we treat these creations with respectIt is paramount that we tackle this the right way
111023,1575930602045329408,It is saddening to see how many voices are discrediting Teslas showcasing of Optimus Tesla Bot at tonights AI Day 2022Many say it will be staged or CGI What all those viewpoints lack is a understanding of just how mindblowing and important todays event is
111025,1575896163483410433,Hey what version is your car on Just checking to make sure 👍
111028,1575615451853307904,That would be the case sadly  Any vehicles without the new cameras MCU2 upgrade and HW3 wont be eligibleCheck in with your local service center about availability Otherwise you absolutely have enough autopilot miles 😢👍
111029,1575614829980569600,The autopilot miles is what matters other miles do not
111030,1575614741547843584,Would just make sure there is at least 100 via the Safety Score tab can view the exact amount via the  i  icon in the top rightOnce that has been surpassed weve typically seen the invite go out within 12 days Just had someone receive it within 3 hours this morning 👍
111031,1575614116055523328,That was fast Congrats and enjoy the update Donald
111032,1575613559395872768,Hey Fred have you driven at least 100 autopilot miles within the last 30 days and is your vehicle on 20222082022209 👍Both are required to be eligible for the current FSD build
111033,1575555953214177281,Then youre all set Just give it a day or two and if you still havent received the update by Saturday or Sunday let us know 👍
111047,1575255577797746692,Tesla Service experiences differ entirely based on location unfortunately Weve had nothing but exceptional experiences but have seen many a horror storyWith that in mind thank you Were here to help whenever possible 👍
111051,1575240590706425856,If this doesnt resolve it than continue with any service appointment you have already made This is often the default recommendation
111052,1575239982557470721,So this is considered a “general fault” with the camera system and while not intuitive the only solution is to literally just let the vehicle fall asleep  restDisconnect it from Wifi close mobile apps disconnect thirdparty services and dont drive it for 12 hours
111054,1574937250709655552,Wed absolutely love this 1
111055,1574873475570728960,On your 2022 have you driven at least 100 miles on autopilot within the last 30 days
111056,1574853043379572737,🤠👋 Enjoy the update and Full SelfDriving Joe Drive safe 👍
111057,1574852448614633472,Once the configs were updated they were in direct communication with engineering since Joes vehicle was meant to be flagged for FSD but hadnt been due to Teslas own causationsEnd result though is the problem was solved 👍
111058,1574852093612941318,One of the cameras installed earlier this year was an incorrect part which was likely one of the culprits Some debugging can be done remotely but other issues wont pop up unless you connect a laptop via the diagnostics port Tech replaced part validated configs
111059,1574813708517195776,Thank you for the update Joe We really appreciate itIf a vehicle is throwing an error even if not visible to the owner it is typically excluded from some software rollouts Something relating to that upgrade may have caused this Luckily should be easy to resolve 🤞
111060,1574806292564037634,It has been awhile since invites went out so remaining on older versions isnt a common behaviorThat being said many have expressed being disappointed by missing out on the current build so we expect more will remain on older versions until 10693s version is announced
111061,1574805257153957892,In most cases besides unusual circumstances nobody who was initially queued for FSD or eligible for it received 202228 It was mostly bad timing of a normal rollout occurring around the same time as invites going out thus many updated their vehicles
111063,1574760438361124866,There is no telling whenwhat version v10693 will be on so this is entirely up to you to decide Typically holding off on updates is not recommended as they include bugsafetysecurity fixes as wellOur suggestion is if you are going to not upgrade dont wait too long
111064,1574410431333965824,You will get an invite to the beta early next month NickNo vehicles on 202224 or 202228 are expected to receive any FSD builds until v10693 Hope this helps
111065,1574244378918367232,We were talking broadly about all vehicles and recalls not just Teslas However still might have overshot it with the count haha
111070,1574121536088248320,Sweet nothings from Dojo wafer to Dojo wafer 🎵
111072,1573740030673096704,202224 and 202228 will get invites to FSD Beta with the release of v10693 which is planned to be available around the first week of October
111073,1573734916163923968,Correct The largest category of pending updates including for this beta is typically “Waiting for Wifi”
111074,1573732412915273728,That makes sense Youll likely need to remain on 208 for at least a few days until youll receive the beta Invites are going out very slowly but steadilyAs a heads up you will need to be connected to a Wifi network to be able to download the beta as well
111075,1573731202669850626,You just received 208 today Just making sure we understand correctly 👍
111076,1573565636474593280,It can take a single test drive or being driven by Full SelfDriving Beta to convince someone to never purchase another ICEFSD is one of the most transformative software released in decades and this is just the beginning
111113,1573336767226597382,Wed suggest staying something along the lines of “I want to check to make sure there arent any warnings or issues preventing my vehicle from receiving the latest Full SelfDriving update 20222017 as most have been pushed to this version Thank you for your time”
111114,1573336061371383811,One vehicle owner had v106922 pushed to their vehicle and were awaiting responses from another two individualsOtherwise every tester should be on the latest build already
111115,1573335690246512641,Weve been suggesting anyone who is stuck on outdated versions of FSD to contact their local service centerLess than 05 of testers have remained on v106911 and v10692 so there might be some warning or issue preventing your vehicle from receiving the latest build
111118,1573325752338096129,Thats the beta Congrats Emmanuel 🙌
111124,1573292701893955585,The camera upgrade is only necessary for older SX vehiclesMake sure youve satisfied the following requirements to be eligible for an invite Have driven at least 100 miles with autopilot enabled in the last 30 days Your vehicles software is on the 202220 branches
111125,1573292228893900800,Fingers crossed for today or tomorrow Weve seen 12 days consistently being the average wait time
111127,1573229026721808385,You wont be able to receive an invite until a new version of the beta comes out 😢 Good news though one is already planned for the first week of October
111133,1573196258726002690,This is great info and otherwise congrats on getting the update 🙌
111134,1573196109832486912,Yay Congrats and glad you finally got an invite ArisTook a little longer than expected but well deserved Thank you for being patient 🙌
111135,1573156620317896708,This is not trueYou can only view autopilot miles via the Safety Score tab within the mobile app and then clicking on the  i  icon in the top right
111140,1573121742603964416,Were referring to all vehiclesLast year there were 35 million vehicles involved in recalls and most recall documents are 34 pages not including the envelopeIf you consider this began in 1966 and hasnt been digitized like other services yes that is concerning
111141,1573116744784551936,Nontransferrable as with other events They typically check ID at the door
111142,1573116605575593984,Your mind will be blown 100 recommend going
111143,1573112020408336386,This would make sense if any sensors or otherwise components on the vehicle are reporting as having issues a vehicle wont receive updatesStrange for it to not display a warning though but might be due to how uncommon this far the camera upgrade has been
111145,1573099683102105602,Weve not heard of this making a notable difference however also assuming that most have this turned on 👍 Any and all data uploaded is anonymized
111146,1573092083900252160,Just got to wait then  New invites have been gradually going out every day
111147,1573090613117222912,What update are you on
111154,1573064732227035137,Woo Thanks for the update and enjoy FSD Beta Tony 🙌
111156,1572993843884363781,Weve received at least two so possibly depends on the stateregion Were in California
111157,1572993253447966721,We meant this in a broad sense so beyond just Teslas but very valid point 😉
111158,1572991040549974016,At the very least verified owners via DMV or otherwise an NHTSAappointed website should be allowed to opt out of physical mail and receive recalls via email instead
111159,1572990131262595072,This also results in tens of millions of trees cut down since NHTSA requires paper notices to be sent with each “recall”Harmful to the environment and confusing to owners and nonowners alike Any way we can petition or request for this terminology to be revised
111160,1572989132087107585,They have all upgrades HW3 MCU2 and camera upgrades May just not updated in the vehicles configuration on the mothership 👍
111161,1572988792893734915,207208209 is in fact needed so being pushed to 209 is a good step No need to drive once youre on that update though just got to wait nowA small handful of new invites went out this morning and last night if you check our timeline 👀 Hoping yall get it
111162,1572988344921124864,What was the bet 👀
111164,1572982291856752640,Thats what were here for 😥 Dont stress yourself out too much as weve seen it still take a couple days after those 100 AP miles for someone to receive an invitev10693 releases early next month and should give you much more time to accomplish that requirement
111167,1572980731076542464,Are you on a 202220X update and have driven at least one hundred miles on autopilot within the last 30 days
111169,1572977379819270145,Service centers dont posses a way of doing this only engineering can assign VINs to the beta program 😥Let us know what they say regardless though
111170,1572973303312297986,This camera upgrade only applies to older SX models
111171,1572972163740872706,This is fixed in an upcoming update 2022361 Should be available next month
111176,1572943652229632005,If were wrong well give away a lifetime premium membership 👍Were fairly confident this will come to fruition during or around the major holiday update although it doesnt take away how long youve had to wait Joe
111178,1572942771434196992,Each and every vehicle that has purchased FSD with HW3MCU2 all 3Y and newer SX and older SX with upgraded cameras will receive access to the beta by the end of the yearIn an absolute worst case scenario youre waiting another two to three months
111184,1572935808461737990,It is factual service team lacks the tools or ability to select someones VIN for inclusion in the beta nor is there a proper route for them to email someone in engineering to request for itNot necessarily a great outcome but that is a solid answer from them 👍
111190,1572786201727479810,In our opinion HW3 is more than adequate for accomplishing FSD and most challenges now can be tackled with further software improvements and validationsHW4 simply helps with the “March of Nines”
111195,1572720836301430785,Employees are typically already on FSD builds since they can get FSD for free if they do so and this vehicle was only on production builds priorWe believe its a friend of a manager who requested it to be manually done This is not recommended for a handful of reasons
111203,1572625620026425344,It is quite the read and 48 pages 💀💀
111204,1572621657499643907,We watched a lengthy video about radiation  solar flares causing bit flips and it was beyond fascinating Errorcorrecting and shielding try their best but it sounds like the solution SpaceX came up with is far better Bravo
111205,1572619622792429570,This implements that same concept but for autonomous vehicles Didnt know it was being utilized within the SpaceX Dragon but would make sense for both companies to borrow principles from one another 🙌Thanks for sharing this Scott
111206,1572618404191940608,If  wishes to comment they may but were tired of this going in circles Too upsetting 😞👍
111207,1572617635254370305,You dont need our interpretation when he literally said verbatim that redundancy never happened“The redundant stacks were never run on both SoCs” and “they started to do 4 camera dashcam that is provided by the B node” what would have been the redundant chipAll good
111208,1572615923173064706,Yes and this attempt never came to fruitionAre you really going to argue with what was directly expressed to us just hours ago by the man himself 🤦‍♂️
111209,1572615289099161600,If we successfully disprove misinformation everyone benefits Narratives that dont accurately portray reality or otherwise misrepresent an aspect of Tesla fades awayOur tweets can have mistakes or errors as well but when we state something as fact it better be 😱
111210,1572614327051653129,Opinions can be debated Facts should notWe spend a lot of time and energy to fight misinformation It is healthy to be skeptical however it becomes saddening when we have to contest the same topics multiple times when there are reliable sources to support our statements 😥
111211,1572613171378278401,They entirely abandoned redundancy and it was never utilized in any builds that reached production PeriodYou can chose to believe Tesla or you can believe everyone who rooted their vehicles and could tell this was not the case
111216,1572567036131430405,To be mindful of privacy reports are not readreviewedlistened to unless you create a service appointment and specify as close as possible the time and date the report was madeProvide as much detail as possible as well as intersectionsphotos if possible
111217,1572564958596198400,When safe to do so always try to click the report button on the touchscreen If this frequently happens or is repeatable in the same location you can report this via a service requestYou wont be required to go in however the feedback should be notedpassed along
111222,1572537318430605313,Chip architecture  errorstate correcting improvementsDojo StructureDojo CoolingHW4
111223,1572535778726805505,Fingers crossed Please keep us updated if you receive the beta Thomas 🤞
111225,1572529559119228928,Chips tend to get smaller not largerThere are 25 Dojo chips in a single Dojo wafer Take a look at how small our boy is
111226,1572528206762381313,In a traditional PC a GPU and a CPU work together to load and process graphics data of a video game to render it on your monitor so in practice they run in parallelHowever a GPUs processors cant errorcorrect nor process data identically to a CPU Thats our point 👍
111227,1572527509023125504,True but this is not what is being discussed in the patent which is at least three processors that are identical processes being utilized for error correction and hardening stability MCU lacks these functions
111228,1572526667054325760,Essentially the autopilot computers HW25HW3s relationship to MCUs is primarily readonly The chip tells the MCU what it is perceivingactions being taken and the renderer translates this to visualsThats about it What is discussed in the patent is not utilized yet
111229,1572525410633814016,HW3 FSD Computer does not have three processors and no processes or scripts are running on MCU1MCU2 related to autopilot coderedundancyThe MCU Main Computer Unit is solely for infotainment visual renders camera recording and other miscellaneous functionalities
111230,1572524508699045890,This ⬆️ HW3  the current cameras can already detect and label several more environmental objects than are actively rendered on the screenJust a matter of showing what is important right now more will be added over time as has been the case
111231,1572523549763706880,These reference visual diagrams within the patent document not codenames for processors
111232,1572523113728069632,You misread it says 402A402N meaning 402A  402B 402C etc 👍
111233,1572522926565634048,The visualizations for FSD are already stunning and improving often We got better bus and truck models this month with trains on the wayTaking this further might be nice but also could be distracting until full autonomy is reached
111234,1572517365086298113,Patents are typically published before implementation to protect against other parties utilizing it When a patent is published is entirely under the control of the patent holderTesla published Dojo  Dojo wafers  HW4  Chip patents weeks before AI Day 2 Thats intentional
111235,1572513755258552321,A patent was published by Tesla a week ago alongside others relating to Dojo Dojo chip wafers and other physical components of HW4
111236,1572512510892441602,I enjoy our talks as always and appreciate the other perspectives even when heated I could be very wrong and will pinch myself if soNone of this takes away from the incredible breakthroughs Teslas Autopilot Team has made this year Software is king ☕️
111237,1572509868015362050,You said This patent was filed in 2018 so I dont think this excerpt describes anything beyond HW3Unless there are three processors all identical running in parallel this statement is false
111238,1572509256087375873,The patent solely focuses on utilizing at least three processors in parallel for redundancy and errorcorrectingYour first response claimed HW3MCU2 is accomplishing this already and thus the patent is already being utilized and not related to HW4
111239,1572508291842084864,Green also clarified this year I dont think there ever was any functional redundancy in prod firmwareThe MCU has never been used for error correcting or redundancy for HW25HW3
111240,1572505098043150336,It is no mistake that patents for Dojo HW4 and improved chip architecture plans including Dojo were all published a week before AI Day IIIf you thought s NVIDIA DRIVE announcement was impressive youll be blown away by what is being announced in under two weeks
111241,1572503358430412801,As stated by  Tesla had to abandon their intent of utilizing HW3s second chip for redundancy long agoThis patent which will be utilized in HW4 aims to eliminate this problem and fortifies stability as Tesla notes erroneous output data cannot be tolerated
111242,1572501228130799618,This is not the focus nor intent of the patent all three processors are identical not arm  x86 and allow for improved error state detection and correctionsThe patent further notes that each parallel processor has identical or nearly identical processing components
111245,1572474156230508544,While this may not take away your disappointment the next update is slated to release around the first week of October just a couple weeks awayJust a little bit more patience and youll be testing out the next build very soon
111249,1572469355597950979,Hey Thomas There is no window as new invites went out all day yesterday so unless this changes you should receive the update within a day of fulfilling the requirementsWeve received several reports of finishing in the morning and then receiving the update by evening
111250,1572462864497283073,What update is your vehicle on
111251,1572457534753210369,You can check this by going to the Safety Score tab of the mobile app and then click on the  i  icon in the top right This should display total miles and those on autopilotWhat update is your vehicle currently on This should show at the bottom of the main page of the app
111252,1572455367535374337,Hey Sako invites are still actively going out throughout the day to eligible vehiclesMake sure you satisfy the following– 100 miles on autopilot within the last 30 days– Have MCU2 Model 3Y newer SX or purchased the upgrade– HW3– Upgraded cameras if an older SX
111258,1572451057590214656,Youve definitely surpassed the required autopilot milesWhat model of vehicle do you have
111259,1572449211618304000,Hey Ben Make sure youve driven at least 100 miles on autopilot not including regular miles 👍You can view this via your Safety Score tab in the top right  i  icon Weve seen new invites going out consistently throughout today
111260,1572448910907682816,Hey Jackson were not seeing this ourselves as 999 of vehicles on 2022209 have received the betaAre you on 2022209 yourself
111261,1572446730398081024,Safe travels and keep us updated
111262,1572446213483679745,We can try to hunt down a few other reports but here is one
111263,1572445942519058433,Weve seen two individuals finish their 100 miles of autopilot this morning and then receive the update by the evening so some delay is expected but weve seen a steady stream of new testers all day so far 👍
111264,1572445743058939905,Only autopilot miles will count without exception Only autopilot miles matter as Tesla needs to ensure you are accustomed to keeping vigilant and your eyes on the road which only matters while on Autopilot
111265,1572444238943780864,Yes it unfortunately has to be autopilot miles
111266,1572443405552328705,Have you two driven 100 miles on autopilot within the last 30 days You can see this within the Safety Score tab of the mobile app by clicking the  i  icon in the top right
111273,1572428488388542464,You can check on your mobile phone within the Safety Score tabThere is no way to check autopilot miles driven within your vehicle
111274,1572428184435724289,Yes weve seen someone complete the one hundred required autopilot miles this morning and receive it just a few hours laterThe total  pending totals for v106922 have continued to increase gradually throughout today
111275,1572427916780380163,Correct it has to be miles driven on Autopilot It states this when first signing up for the queue although this was added around NovemberDecember last year
111277,1572427149814165505,Aris have you driven at least 100 miles on Autopilot within the last 30 days This can be seen by clicking the  i  icon within the Safety Score section of the mobile appHope this helps
111278,1572426855147532294,He should have specified The intention of only Autopilot miles counting is that FSD requires your full attention and eyes forced on the roadWhen utilizing FSD safely is paramount Tesla wants to ensure you are accustomed to that expectation 👍
111285,1572420475896336386,Awesome this was our suspicion but wanted to make sure
111286,1572404826688098304,In particular 100 miles of autopilot autosteer
111287,1572392063668473856,See this thread for more context but was an isolated case
111288,1572390509548802051,To confirm did you drive at least one hundred miles while on AutopilotAutosteer Or just driving in general
111289,1572390130929008641,Congrats and thank you for the confirmation
111290,1572387846677467137,There are no “slots” the 60K were simply those included in this initial wave of new invitesElon has already stated new invites will go out as vehicles are deemed eligible 👍
111291,1572376048154865667,Youre far more proactive than most haha Glad to hear that both shared the same sentimentFingers crossed that it works itself out 🤞
111292,1572375040196513792,With this in mind the update and download should resolve itself automatically however if it doesnt by tomorrow night youll want to make a service appointmentThey should be able to manually resolve it remotely without you having to go in person to the service center
111293,1572374700537581570,We passed this along to a Service Center manager and what they believe happened wasYou had 282 queued and not yet installed however as the beta invite resulted in 2017 being pushed en masse it overrode the prior update but isnt reflecting properly via the APIs
111294,1572371961858387972,Elon has communicated that v10693 is planned to release in early October so there is a likelihood that the new FSD build will be on the 202228 branch 👍Just a couple weeks away at most
111295,1572371263074738176,This is definitely odd and might explain the one other vehicle weve seen across thirdparty logging services that went from 282 to 2017We suggest letting it do its thing for a while and rebooting via steering wheel buttons if necessaryAppreciate you sharing this Tony
111297,1572368885348958209,While downgrading versions is possible it introduces many risks for install failures requiring a service center appointment which is why this has not happened outside of very special instancesThankfully v10693 is just a couple weeks away 👍
111298,1572367792867004421,Tony if your vehicle received 202228 then it was unfortunately not flagged to receive the beta 20222017 at the time of that downloadThere has been no recorded instance of a vehicle claiming to download a specific version and then installing a different one
111307,1572345979202064386,What appears to be the case is someone requested this during a service appointment and was given approval We absolutely dont recommend this nor ideal to ask your own service center Many have asked and will be refused  the appointment canceled
111308,1572345552037380097,Jumping in for some additional contextWhile downgrading is possible it is typically not recommended and often requires someone at a Service Center namely a manager to approve and perform the rollbackThis isnt common as it increases the risks of unexpected behavior
111309,1572344884924919810,Based on what has been communicated by  anyone currently on the 202220x branch and is eligible for FSD should receive it on a rolling basis possibly every few daysweekOur prior statement only applies if youre on 202224 or 202228 as downgrading is unlikely
111310,1572334094209667077,Yes and no you can only access Safety Score data if it is also available in the mobile appThis means that unless you are part of the Safety Score queue andor have Tesla Insurance we cant access this data nor will it populate
111318,1572129599664066562,Also not sure youd want to use FSD in certain areas of Mexico or near the border to be completely fair IMOLots and lots of potholes especially with the recent tropical storm that would destroy your bumper if FSD doesnt detect one 💀
111319,1572128897751457792,To be honest havent tried If you enter Mexico while on the Safety Score queue itll kick you out of it this happened to us early on unfortunatelyUnsure about actually utilizing FSD though but it might be geofenced similarly to regions in Canada
111321,1572128202461712384,As long as a vehicle was already on an FSD build which this vehicle was it can receive new builds regardless of the region theyre presently inWe travel to Mexico from time to time from California
111334,1572091711945592832,This is fantastic news for so many thank you for the confirmation 👍
111337,1572090493617704961,Hey Elon checking inWill we see vehicles currently in the Safety Score queue with scores above 80 receiving the beta now that v106922 has rolled out to current testersThanks as always
111367,1571578250446635009,Youre fine We just wanted to check just in case 👍
111368,1571577173303238657,This update has only gone out to employees you may be confusing it with v10692
111369,1571354312022040578,We hosted an outdoor wedding afterparty and used the speakers of our Model 3 Performance nobody could believe how amazing it soundedA few signed up for test drives that same night
111371,1571160425995317251,Another individual who had originally rejected delivery due to a minor paint chip on their bumper but discovered their vehicle had HW25 and not HW30 despite the build date being in May😢 Just trying to help share insight
111372,1571156869665914886,I understand if you feel that our outlook is reaching in regard to the full transition all new vehicles to HW4 however debating facts is not something Id like to engage in respectivelyOtherwise always appreciate constructive discussions regarding the future
111373,1571156109905494017,HW3 was announced during Autonomy Day and Tesla stated that “all vehicles built today have the hardware necessary for Full SelfDriving”This was not true and we personally witnessed dozens of owners on Twitter report receiving HW25 several months even having purchased FSD
111374,1571155469003280391,Then you consider hundreds to thousands of vehicle owners liars then
111382,1571027698344132608,All eyes are on  now 👍 With the patent for HW4 now public theres a lot of excitement in the air
111383,1571026898939150337,It wont take Tesla a year due to the improvements theyve made to production the last couple years It took about 6 months for the shift from MCU2 to MCU3Our Q3 estimation implies HW4 wont appear in new vehicles until the Q1Q2 of next year and thus 46 months to shift
111384,1571025562302550018,Unless it was not communicated to the vehicle owners prior and they were given inventory vehicles there were still vehicles being delivered as brand new ordered to spec and not via Teslas Inventory site receiving HW25This was possibly due to the production roadblocks
111385,1571024375704588288,We discussed this and provided proof of this in the prior threadcommentsIf you scan Twitter the Tesla Owners Online  Tesla Motors Club forums and other FB groups youll find many reports of newly delivered vehicles throughout 2019 with HW25
111387,1571022894918160384,Were proclaiming this as an educated opinion based on timelines communicated by    and  recently stating that Teslas Robotaxis are now coming in 2024HW4 is not yet vehicles and it took over a year after announced for HW3 to replace HW25
111388,1571009185789390849,We anticipate that Tesla will first push the update to current testers however it is safe to assume that everyone who has been patiently waiting should receive a Full SelfDriving update sometime within the next two weeks
111391,1570999857938329600,As communicated by  this update v106921 is expected to release to nonemployee vehicles over the next couple of days with rollouts to specific groups potentially occurring as early as tonight
111399,1570356905914298372,We highly encourage those in Australia to collaborate and comment on this tweet from the official  account🙌 Good luck friends
111406,1570252909253885953,Palos Verdes so Los Angeles area
111418,1570054894857654272,Couldnt agree more 👍 Were blow away by the progress the Autopilot Team has made since the first days of FSD and even before then all via softwareNow imagine two more years of progress with Dojo onlineNever underestimate software
111420,1570051304797638656,We try to be insightful with our viewpoints but at the end of the day they are still opinions and just as valid as anyone elses 👍Skepticism is healthy and keeps you on your toes Were optimistic about the last two years of progress and high hopes leading towards 2024
111421,1570050699777691648,We have to all remember that only one measurement of success of an AV is the number of miles driven without a crucial mistake or accidentIf HW3 reaches 6M miles and HW4 is 78M miles can the logistical cost of retrofitting a million vehicles be justified Hard to tell 🤷‍♂️
111422,1570049590426243074,One could argue that if HW4s safety is greater than HW3 than everyone who purchased FSD should be entitled to an upgradeWhich is fair however were confident that with software alone the average FSD purchaser wont be able to tell the difference between HW3 and HW43
111423,1570048270784958472,It is paramount to any ridesharing implementation that liabilities are lowered to avoid litigation due to passenger injury Thus Tesla will want all participating vehicles to have the latest and greatest stack for their own sake and yoursHW4 matters in this instance 2
111424,1570047587813826566,Full SelfDriving will include Robotaxi and let us know if our tweets imply otherwise However as for when you sign your vehicle up for UberLyft there is a process and vetting to ensure driver and future passenger safetyTesla will legally need to handle this similarly 1
111429,1569843529496805376,described this perfectly earlier as “a ball of yarn” If you tug in one direction fixing a specific aspect of autonomy it can sometimes result in an imbalance on the other side of the yarnWith enough time each side gets attention and solidifies
111430,1569842881745268737,This is extremely useful for when a vehicle is having sleep issues caused by a thirdparty polling too often but it should also be used for determining the sourceIPs especially if they included any headers in the requestsGood luck
111431,1569842540651880448,Jumping in to recommend making a service appointment ASAP if you havent already in the meantime  Each and every request made via the APIs is logged to the vehicle and the service team has tools for determining the origin of the requests
111432,1569839746461081600,Aw no We are anticipating this will happen soon though just awaiting an update from Elon for those waiting on the Safety Score programHows the beta and feedback looking so far for an extended pool of testers
111434,1569838540485435394,Hows v10692 been treating you on your daily commute or to other unfamiliar locations Elon We took a drive this morning through LA and it was beyond confident Excited for what is being showcased at AI Day 2Been awhile since v81 so were checking in
111436,1569836925871333376,One of the latest tweets I could find from green this year confirming the redundancy chip being utilized for compute instead
111437,1569836392162918401,Discussions with  in years last their tweets and more recent discussions with other vehicle owners with modifiedrooted hardwareLoosely based on subjective information from publicly showcased slides and talks
111442,1569831795054776330,FPS bottlenecks also arent always the result of not enough processing power or wiggle room They can be from a single inefficient function or protocol causing the entire stack to have a performanceefficiency hitThrowing more compute at the problem is just a bandaid 👍
111443,1569831305499770880,With deployable systems you ideally never want to get past 8590 in case of unexpected blips or intense workflows Just a good principle that is followed whenever possibleMCU2 used to instantly hit 8090 when route traffic was enabled Within months this was improved
111453,1569789611110711296,As Tesla will make a cut of all Robotaxi rides via personal vehicles it is our hope and assumption that they would eat the cost of a retrofit especially since it is assumed HW4 will bring additional costsavings over HW3Well likely get more details on AI Day 2 👍
111454,1569789197921419264,Yeah We purposefully didnt state paid as we werent intending for it to imply such Its entirely in Teslas ballpark with what direction they go however we share the same opinion as  that retrofitting several millions of vehicles isnt feasible logistically
111457,1569787657508765698,Current computer still has 3040 wiggle room with redundancies turned off which it has been for quite some timeRecent reworks of the NNs and other underlying processes gave more wiggle room than youd imagine 👍
111459,1569786860758777857,Our thoughts in a sidethread TLDR only necessary if you fully intend to utilize and profit off Robotaxi at which point Tesla will insist on HW4 for liabilitys sakeOtherwise HW3 is all you need for the life of a majority of Tesla vehicles on the road
111461,1569785687242862595,Weve also seen FSD perform practically every time of maneuver across thousands of videos granted at times with less confidence than one may desireThe rest is up to software at this point
111462,1569785383789133824,We can say it based on the confidence from Teslas own Autopilot Team  and HW3 was the first chip designed by Tesla for the sole purpose of autonomy and produced horizontally HW25 and before were making use of what was possible at the time
111468,1569781848846512128,If someone is interested in utilizing Robotaxi on their vehicle they will need to go through a somewhat extensive checklist due to liabilities for your own vehicle and Teslas liability for passengersUpgrading to HW4 is likely to be handled during this process
111469,1569781577932242944,Legally only Full SelfDriving is promised during vehicle purchase and we have no concerns that this will be fully possible while on HW3Those interested in utilizing Robotaxi on their HW3 vehicles is very small and entirely manageable in terms of service retrofits to HW4
111484,1569468612192403456,No rumors only hopes We expect additional invites to go out in the following weeks if v10692 looks good however if not everyone should get it by years endHoping for an update from  regarding this
111487,1569322220429930496,Update went out to practically every single tester thankfully Safety Score peeps are still waiting for invites but hoping  will have an update for those vehicle owners soon 👍
111505,1569222588995616768,No new invites have gone out at this time  were hoping for an update for Safety Score vehicle owners
111523,1569181737087029248,Were keeping an eye out for when this rollout occurs Thank you to everyone on the Autopilot Team for their hard work  How are we looking for invites to go out to those with Safety Scores
111557,1568803150806806529,One of the latest tweets from  stated that the update was delayed by a day and thus started tonightThe public rollout will begin tomorrow assuming everything looks good
111569,1567368748075749376,Or a toggle between “off” with a notable warning and normal nonJoe Mode volume 👍
111576,1567354960429588480,Completely understand that frustration DarewWeve seen many requests to the Tesla Team and to  to associate the beta with a Tesla Account and not a VIN This would feel less punishing to owners who already waited through the Safety Score process
111578,1567353457178476546,Our hope is that new invites will go out within a few days or a week of v10692s release With this in mind as long as you have a score of 97 of above you have a chance of joining the betaWed recommend keeping an eye out for tweets regarding this from
111594,1567345215656296448,Congrats Enjoy the update
111600,1566759019510767621,Our platform automatically detects and tweets when a new update is released This includes data from over 15000 vehiclesThis however does not mean our own personal vehicle received the betaOur tweet was simply to request for a feature that would benefit everyone equally
111608,1566639771622944768,This is unrelated to the Full SelfDriving updates Stevie Which we did not get on our vehicleTheres no reason to treat others that way
111609,1566597963295571968,Transparency goes a long way 👍
111610,1566582174932877312,Weve not consistently included release notes on our website in quite some time  Having accessible release notes that are tailored for the vehicle owner would only make for a better experience
111611,1566576478757715971,Hey Elon whenever a new update is released for vehicles owners are always excited to see whats newAny chance we can view the release notes for the current version were on within the mobile app Would vastly improve customer happiness
111693,1580614502294335488,So many ppl angry at this goofy yet accurate tweet  sold over 2Ok bottles of perfume in like 2 days How many EVs has GM sold since Jan 2022 I rest my case 🤣😂Yall need to go put some aloe on that burn if it hurts Better go to Home Depot and get a plant
111695,1580609376389242880,That would be awesome
111696,1580608088020615168,Next major release should be 106942 🤭
111697,1580607347445366785,Would love to see one of these given to  cc   They are helping to train Ukrainian soldiers and could use a terminal
111698,1580606405236920320,I feel sorry for ppl who are eaten up by hate and envy They are truly miserable
111705,1580435007931576320,Im a journalist who supports —actually supported him before becoming oneSo strange that ppl act like you cant be a journalist and support ElonI seriously dont understand why he gets so much hateAlso dont need a horse
111708,1580410209758871552,There actually is a market where people sell used underwear and such I saw a TikTok video about it once I guess that means theres a market for everything🤣
111711,1580407701846528000,Damn Im sorry for hurting your skin with that sick burn You may want to go to the emergency room and have that looked at😂
111732,1580311734358720512,I told her she was right lol

111737,1580300403899392000,On the phone with an old friend who told me I was nuts to spend 100 on s burnt hair perfume 🤣🤣
111738,1580296245460885505,most likely well over that
111739,1580294027752394752,How much have you sold now
111742,1580276003150057472,Elon asking for a friend in Ukraine Is there a way to get one of the donated terminals to  My friend  is there volunteering with SOLI to help train the military
111744,1580254608605470720,I really think he was doing it to troll in to see if people would buy it And it would make a funny gag gift🤣
111746,1580253119488794625,Ill go first I bought mine for a few resins Im curious to see if it actually smells like burnt hair or if Elons gonna surprise us with something niceI also support  which seems to be taboo for journalists so many hate comments over the years
111748,1580252195391348737,Wow So WSJ wants to know why ppl are buying Burnt Hair
111750,1580226744702816256,Yooo  Ill write up on it but its been 11 hours since you tweeted Id love an updated number—for accuracy and all Im sure its well over 1M now
111751,1580225009720909824,Good morning How many bottles have sold now 👀
111764,1580045568000536576,yo I think I found s alt account  👉👉
111771,1580006150195773443,Poll how many bottles of Burnt Hair does  plan on selling
111773,1579993786754961408,it ships q1 2023
111777,1579991605268054017,Only reason I wouldnt use with a lighter is because its better to do the lighter thing with hairspray Plus Im scared of fire
111778,1579988278010580993,Tbh a good use for s burnt hair perfume is self defenseSpray in the eyes of your attacker Or up their nose
111780,1579987013679591424,I cant believe I bought it🤣 wait a minute yes I can
111788,1579958921120608257,Id explore it Im the crazy one who fights back
111790,1579942055799033856,Hi  is there a way to get one of the donated Starlinks to My friend is volunteering with them training militaryTheyve used Starlink before to do interviews but it was shared They need it for basic training etc 📸
111794,1579890897084633089,What do people stand to gain when making these claims about you It just doesnt make sense to spread unnecessary misinfor about you and this dumb war Russia is waging on Ukraine Especially when youve done so much to help
111795,1579873887625805825,Yeah Elon was kind to me when I was homeless Changed my life for the better
111799,1579713177528709121,You say weird like its a bad thing And making fun of ppl for being kind and supportive shows your bitter heart I pity you
111800,1579711609035165696,I dont work for Elon Nice try tho
111803,1579661926136971264,So I guess my point is that we need to look deeper Have compassion and empathy for peopleWe all react to pain trauma other challenges in very different ways
111804,1579661518320566272,The person who I was 10 years ago no longer exists either We all deal with the challenges of life in many ways And it changes us Pain is something that many will unalive themselves to escape And for those of us who survive  it warps us
111805,1579641005871362048,I hope thats the case His tweet was concerning Hopefully Ye will listen to Elon
111807,1579629461246726144,Ive always been a fan of Yes Many songs from his album 808s and Heartbreak was on repeat during some tough times in my 20s Keep being a good friend to him Good friends who are trustworthy are rare
111812,1579600446435774464,That is so cool I was wondering what inspired him Thanks for sharing 🤗😃
111819,1579503666222235650,Without a common goal humanity will fight itself
111822,1579262815055269888,Thanks for caring and doing the good you do Elon It is appreciated
111830,1579107456369983488,Elon listen to her plz Eva always gives good advice You cant help anyone without caring for yourself first Trust me on that—I learned that the hard way
111839,1578879430847770624,Guys JD is right PayPals media spokesperson just told me that they are not going to do this I just published it on Teslarati
111858,1578763579570147328,Im glad Elons helping yall with Starlink Its definitely a life saver
111864,1578507107090825216,Would love to see a video of a Cybertruck being made with the Giga Press set against some Cyberpunk music
111869,1578434390941609985,Elon a friend of mine is on the ground in Ukraine helping to train the military I interviewed her She reviewed Starlink Cc
111876,1578222566007009280,Im sure  got way more than 10K likes on his tweet in the 7 hours since its been posted Twitter is glitching hard Its making us like our own tweets replies and RTs but removing the likes from others on our tweets Its happening to me and others
111878,1578207733391667202,Twitter doesnt like me Fuck em Ill just spend more time on TikTok
111883,1578161411741880320,I thought the same while writing it Was like wt actual f
111884,1578161003983880192,Agree seems sketch af
111887,1578142242748784640,Twitter is glitching Its not just  liking his own tweet but all usersIts happening to me as well Go look at your likes Heres mine—and I didnt like these recently
111888,1578134748823691265,Im def not pro Russia or Putin Id rather punch him in the eye tbh
111908,1578072975122862080,Elon has demonstrated empathy many times He had tears in his eyes in an interview when he found out people in Australia couldnt afford electricity And when I interviewed him I watched him passionately talk about helping people These are just two instances
111909,1578053272195194880,True He and I differ on opinion I think the light of consciousness created us Its embedded in every cell animal atom planet object—and it evolves Ppl perceive it differently
111910,1578052125124448256,True and neither would those of us who support him Nuclear war would be incredibly devastatingWhen I interviewed Elon he spoke of the light of consciousness He doesnt want it to die It will die with humanity if were not careful
111911,1578050828136587272,I admire and respect  I dont think hes trying to appease Putin or throw shade on UkraineIts his love for humanity and fear of us fucking around with nukes and possibly wiping out civilization that inspires him to advocate for peacePpl should listen to him
111914,1577848553040388097,💯 Idk Public Citizen or why Elon blocked them I do know Elon Ive met and interviewed him And hes helped my community after major hurricanes have hit us And he was kind to me when I lost everything in 2018 Hes good hearted and genuine
111916,1577846392638537728,So weird that Twitter is flagging your account Elons super nice and good hearted I hope you get unblocked by him soon
111917,1577838176818823169,Praying for your safety friend ❤️
111918,1577834942326784003,For those who cant see the flag its a new a Twitter feature being rolled out I took a screenshot of the bottom part that wasnt visible in the screen recording
111919,1577833845570912256,This makes me think  didnt actually block you
111921,1577831014327631872,Hes a hater And a creep
111922,1577828527742795776,Its so creepy how you dedicate your account to try to bring Elon and Tesla down imho
111926,1577734649807339521,Im sure Elon knows you meant well Renata Youre a huge support to him and this community of ppl who support him We know you meant well Im sure Elon does too
111939,1577647648248578049,I would play and win Always was good at monopoly
111940,1577647167682101249,sent thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine Not sure why ppl falsely claim he never did
111951,1577437067910709248,Congrats on this move Elon Rooting for you
111964,1577293042280718339,Russia doesnt want peace tho It would have never invaded Ukraine if it wanted peace I think Elon meant well when he laid out his idea but his idea calls for Ukraine sacrificing even more And they prob feel betrayed by this
111965,1577291987073613824,Agreed I support Elon but I think emotions are high everywhere Elons actions with Starlink helped Ukraine Elon I think is worried about humanity as a whole The loss of life and possibly civilization And his solution to solve this problem is a high cost to Ukraine
111968,1577089562639491073,is there helping Shes seen a lot
111972,1577036687959416832,Caring about the deaths of millions shows your heart But Elon Russia doesnt want peace If they did they never would have invaded Ukraine at all They raped and killed people And it will continue unless Russia decides it wants peace

123776,1566834212249800704,Thats what Tesla keeps saying but until its finished and proven it wont and customers keep losing value and being asked to pay more and more
123777,1566832164603195393,As a customer of Tesla since 2015 and having bought this license many times I believe Tesla is heading down a dangerous pathYes this is only my opinion and I am a shareholder and supporter of Tesla but I do not agree with this pricing approach with FSD
123780,1566828367222956032,What Im saying is if Tesla thinks the value of the FSD license is worth so much they should out their money where their mouth is and show increased value for that license on trade in
123781,1566828206409125888,That has nothing to do with the FSD license This is true of any car
123782,1566828114901999617,Yes I recently sold my 2017 Model S 100D and confirmed prices with and without FSD and it did not substantially increase the value privately
123783,1566827065512316928,Private will not pay more for the FSD license Not while its unfinished Can you show any stats showing private sales are paying a higher price for the FSD license
123785,1566817067314999296,If that was true why would they not have already launched the subscription model in Canada
123786,1566811187295113216,If Tesla truly believed in this unfinished product they would offer the customers paying for it a way to transfer the license or get the appreciated value from the license on trade in
123787,1566810494874177537,Never paying that price its outside the realm of reality for a product that is not finished and soon to be replaced with HW4

145115,1578460219105247232,Someone is simply inciting hatred between you and the Ukrainians pushing our foreheads together Obvious manipulation We know who benefits this
145116,1578457906185261057,he calculates options based on various information he voiced the conclusion he came to but this doesnt mean that he will push it to the end he really loves Ukrainians and admires our courage and besides that he helps with Starlinks
145117,1578456355782152192,Come to Ukraine and see for yourself what is left of the great russian people tell about the great russians to those children women and men whom they raped

145120,1578445994697850880,Obviously there are things that we as nonprofessionals dont understand I am sure that the Starlink team is working hard to help Ukraine as much as possible in the current conditions
145121,1578444564636913664,Now the russians are weak and need peace in order to gather an army again and continue to kill Now they are working to pave the way for this We can not give them this otherwise in a few years more innocent victims will follow

145317,1572473646500945920,I havent seen her tweet apologizing to me and Jonna yet I know it can be difficult for her but if she wants to correct her mistakes then she needs to admit them and take real steps to appease those she offended
145319,1572471652436381696,If she publicly apologizes to me and Johnna and she really is to blame for this whole situation then I will no longer raise this topic Our actions always speak louder about us than any words so my further attitude towards her will depend on her further behavior
145320,1572470186363736064,If she behaves like a dick for many years then it is difficult to come to peace You know I always focus on goodness and try to bring positivity to our community which is why it hurts me so much to see someone else destroy positive and mutually respectful communication…
145321,1572468688753930240,I see her playing the victim but ask her about me and Johnna and have her publicly tell why she blocked me a couple of years ago and taunted me or why she attacked Johnna making her look badShe perfectly understands why she has such an attitude from me
145322,1572463139660394496,There are people who care about others and bring positive and there are those who split and bring negativity with their behindthescenes games Unfortunately Glen belongs to the second type
145323,1572461123621748736,That is why her baseless hatred of me and Johnna stands out so strongly She seems nice to others but Johnna and I have become the object of her hatred Although after Elon started following me she changed her attitude towards me
145324,1572458127231942656,Maybe if she hated individuals like me and Johnna less then she would have a different situation Im sure twitter isnt hiding her replies from you but it might be downvoting them due to complaints about her account

145951,1573190165744746496,Its no coincidence that the same people who hate you want to keep majority of people dumbed down and poverty stricken Thats how control works
145973,1573005431504793601,Thats probably why they need you to buy Twitter so bad so you can fix it
145985,1572576316402331649,Not only is Elon selfmade the things hes done to help humanity along with his goals to extend the human consciousness are beyond what youd expect from anyone He has a full understanding of how precious life truly is His mom  definitely did something right
145986,1572572058353291266,Hes literally shared his childhood story Elon is clearly very close with his mom who raised him This isnt rocket science
145987,1572571679272087557,You know more about your childhood than some randoms on the internet Wild
145988,1572568510043418625,They have you deep in the shadows 100 being suppressed for sentiment reasons while negative threads about you are pumped relentlessly in the algosI wonder what incentive Twitter has to make Elon Musk look bad Hmm 🤔😒

145991,1572563106521579521,They keep rerunning the same lies about you  maybe you need to give them some new material Id gladly take a horse in exchange 😏
145997,1572423656365760517,Silenced and still no edit button 😒
145998,1572423273522294785,This is 100 true Your biggest supporters are silences in an attempt to mask sentiment just like they do with elections
145999,1572418192815058944,Must be related to
146000,1572416397149605888,I would say Twitter is going to shadowban you for this but they already did
146004,1572362424464080896,No kidding I wonder what  would think of the SEC spending 460000 taxpayer dollars to influence retail investors considering many refer to Tesla and Doge as memes as well I mean he did pay more taxes than anyone in history 👀
146011,1572090955012141056,So Ill be able to respond to your tweets while my Tesla parks itself 😄

146044,1571349250717650950,Sorta like giving Starlink to humanity
146053,1570958747127943169,As long as the government doesnt have control of it
146058,1570891585004642305,Have you had the same experience with Twitter
146059,1570889258805899265,So everytime  responds to me I get shadowbanned afterward
146105,1570235785466744833,We need one with Bill Gates 😂
146113,1570222579339898881,I think  would love the space ✨️
146114,1570222185146634240,As long as  sends the doge hell be safe 😸

146129,1569901409910521856,Me helping Elon make memes fit better on Twitter
146135,1569869501583491072,I think it may have multiple utilities

146144,1569828620260220930,Now this is amazing marketing
146145,1569825866930352128,How much will it cost to blow your whistle 😏
146152,1569812682223796225,When you find out Twitter has spies on the board 🍿

146157,1569794755894312960,Did you see his popcorn tweet 😳
146158,1569794479665868801,Apparently I slept through  aka Naughtius Maximus responding to me again I really should turn on his notifications hes being heavily suppressed by Twitter
146160,1569708277369573376,Maybe this was Elons plan all along
146171,1569697039583440898,Things keep getting worse for Twitter defense team trying to force  to buy their bot riddled company Today former Twitter security chief stated the platforms leadership is misleading the public lawmakers regulators and even its own board of directors
147151,1580399136003657728,They already have a solution for it They worked on it while B7 was sitting there in between the chopsticks a few days ago  Its not a once and done process tho Correct measure correct repeat…
147157,1580288798663245825,I explain what I am able to on twitter and then go into full detail in my videosI think a lot of folks might disagree with your Based on your history statement
147158,1580288340808839170,Im just letting yal know its about to happen Doesnt mean Im ready to explain it I dont rush things like that
147160,1579960388019703809,Not sure if its normal to depress this fast Ive never seen that happen
147161,1579959908312567808,Not so sure about that If they werent being held by the chopsticks there is no way to tell how much more it would be crunched right now
147162,1579958650525077504,Wow Look how quickly  lost pressure just now  That was quite the crunch Payload section is pretty dang heavy I guess  This is real time speed🎥
147181,1578725055017558017,Ive considered this as well back when I first saw the raptor 2  It looks ejectable when its not in its final form
147187,1578416276136808449,Wheres that edit feature at though
147193,1578353661880647680,My alarm clock was in the process of failing to do its job for the 5th day in a row when I received this notification    Lol that was pretty effective
147218,1576392915982512128,Once prop loading begins the tank should generate its own pressure At that point they can swap over to nitrogen
147219,1576335260958093312,Hes a patron so he saw the early release
147225,1575510965017362432,“Turn around dont drown”  NWS“Drive your cyber truck across the River”  EM 🤣
147226,1575510138470924288,Lmaooo hopefully it has a rescue beacon
147236,1574641165890355202,Booster 9 Aft Section was moved into the Megabay tonight This is the first to not have Hydraulic Power Units mounted onto the side We are assuming this will be the first booster to use the new Raptor 21 engines with Electric Thrust Vector Control  🎥
147241,1574469539772993557,Raw steel  It stripped every single layer of paint off
147266,1572982130212306944,Welpthe no edit feature plagues us all
147267,1572981148745334790,Hey   is there is a chance this new anti detonation system will allow SpaceX to return to doing spin primes the way you were before
147274,1572773552687808513,As expected SpaceX also tested the secondary water system This new system looks slightly more delugelike   Im still on the fence if thats what its intended to be Its currently labeled as FIREX🎥
147280,1572576192229933056,Structural steel for the 3rd Orbital Launch Integration tower has been arriving rather quickly to the Roberts Road facility No columns on site yetReally wondering what the timeline on that third tower is looking like  📸
147282,1572564138806874112,Is there anything being done with the temporary setup used for Static Fires  Seems like the Launch Mount still has more work left to go
147316,1571373048334278659,Couldnt show it in a tweet if I wanted to  Details are too small Once we are able to show what it looks like we will
147320,1571305486758150144,More like a thank you for directing us to pay attention to it
147321,1571298143832084480,Hey   just so you know the new internal blast protection for the interior edge of the table looks pretty cool We see what you mean now
147324,1570957030361550848,Not saying this is a bad thing Its just something to note
147325,1570955101778620420,Most space related inventions are intended for peaceful purposes What they actually get used is often not the same as what creator wanted In the case of Starlink it has enabled UA to fight back when their comms were cut So one way or another SpaceX is apart of that conflict
147361,1569872193953341440,The long episode will be early next week Just finished the script this morning
147362,1569865017079513090,Should  apologize to   within the next 72 hours
147363,1569849638651416577,Hey  today we are going to reflect on one of the greatest lies ever told by  😲Once you finish this episode you will agree   owes  an apologyDont miss the premier in 30 minutes 915 pm EST
147385,1569380381459206144,Yea I understand that What I mean is where is LN2 being supplied from Because there are no LN2 lines on the launch mount unless you switch CH4 or LOX over to LN2
147386,1569349322227032070,Where is this liquid nitrogen going to come from
147408,1568013577449250816,Its much better than a lot of us expected honestly Definitely an improvement from past tests  That was quite the show
147421,1567638612358864896,lol I highlighted them in red
147425,1567555328627163137,The small amount of water that manages to not get vaporized will end up in this storm drain
147426,1567534313641500674,No they shouldnt need approval for this They have a method of collecting it already
147458,1566051183080374273,That looks awesome  Performance model with FSD
147462,1565856068508565508,This is something I considered One pump pulling too much suction and starving the others I wish I could see the telemetry data for that system I could probably find the issue pretty quickly
147466,1565846346476699648,The amount of cryo pumps we have witnessed being replaced at the  Orbital Tank farm is concerning I wish we knew why this keeps happening   For now Im guessing its just a part of dialing in the process Sigh…another LOX pump down…
148058,1580603342082183168,elon r u tweeting from an aeroplane using Starlink

148092,1580037886744797184,AI couldnt create a more original headline lol
148093,1580034595470180352,im bringing this up again because we do know that elon may be making decisions about twitter based off of the war in Ukraine these are hard questions and you dont make friends asking them i believe being open about these questions helps remove investor doubt
148094,1580033893448548352,theres something hanging tsla up rn if its the threat of nuclear war promulgated by russia and fwd looking tesla decisions are being made because of this it needs to be stated clearly on the next earnings call imo  help investors understand 💛
148095,1580029856288362496,also several prominent holders have mentioned a stock buyback with no sign of a response from tesla investor relations can we get something out on this as well dont make us side with gary on a tesla PR department 🤣💀
148096,1580029284931973122,you need to find a way to convey to investors if youre selling a certain stock a huge swath of retail is getting decimated not by your answer but the uncertaintytesla board said they care about retail investors coming from a good place here but the uncertainty is brutal
148104,1579996325592313857,thats like 69 billion dogenice
148108,1579978784316755968,because almost everybody has hair and burnt hair smells like asstagline go ahead use it you wont

148114,1579948172889427968,elons one of those rare only public voices i trust easy to back you here for that reason
148116,1579940430053273600,exactly thats the fucking bar
148117,1579939902766010369,develop a bot that replies funnier memes to  posts and i will bend the knee to the AI overlords 🤗
148127,1579728424448712705,production is easymaking new countries is hard
148129,1579713217626267650,tagging  is cliche but he literally asked people to do this hes managing service center issues personallyyoure welcome lol
148136,1579620778852876288,maybe after awhile the revolving door that exists between spaceX  tesla can add a new optionimagine twitter being that well regarded would be a testament to the hard work elon will have to put in
148137,1579620273145671680,probably finding talent and retaining it
148163,1579242921244921856,we need a spoilers filter on twitter  😂 i havent seen the new movie
148168,1579124565380583424,i know elon doesnt have a filter and i repsect everyones right to say what theyre thinking i also acknowledge it may not be good telling people to prepare for death every day on twitter dot com
148169,1579123677383118849,i had to 180 my opinion of USs early responseassessment turns out they were on top of it and correct about most of the initial russia movts
148170,1579122019148660737,i dont think freaking out 50M or so people daily about nuclear war is a good thing not at all
148171,1579119897136594944,people are bad drivers lol
148172,1579119782510882816,imagine slamming on the brakes whilst hydroplaning lmao
148173,1579104240039256065,there is no threat of tactical nuke until Russia orders large amounts of troops out of strategic areas theyre doing the opposite with ground war escalation USs intel has been good from the beginning when theyre worried im worried they havent signaled yet
148175,1578903121837035520,i f elon likes your tweet we get humans on Mars in 5 years
148182,1578834889470005248,this is why we anon anon 😔
148183,1578834488272236544,sucks that evs have to fight an uphill polarizing battle vs gas cars before we even think about supporting infrastructure for self driving
148188,1578828878994321408,ok this makes more sense for X payment processing if that is one branch of X what size tree would X be in total
148190,1578825305116246017,i hesitate to detail it surely would dox where im at FSD would have saved a life tho i know it
148191,1578823872182628353,my local highways are a deathfield yesterday we had the most gruesome accident would have never happened had some of the cars been running FSD
148194,1578614792126103554,no i go full flatline 💀😅
148196,1578613385024839680,because i care  watch this and understand how Disney took advantage of todays version of word of mouth ts 1520 for the point but worth the entire watch Tesla basically makes individual theme park rides
148197,1578610857738522624,i think ive invented a useful brain function that allows me to completely zombiebrain when a youtube ad plays 😤 its pretty great and  should install it in neuralink for the masses
148220,1578401095579205632,another mistake alot of pros are making rn is assuming  isnt going to buy twitter thats another headinsand dream he is and hes covering all bases because he isnt dumb
148223,1578398620986085376,is probably selling TSLA well have to wait for filings to verify volume levels look similar to his other selling windows if youre a shareholder i think the worst is probably over after today read your charts this is the way
148224,1578394326496940032,are you done selling TSLA this week
148231,1578212534716440579,mass reports of selfliked tweetsmass unfollowings then followswtf are they trying to hide
148232,1578212276707917824,twitter the app  people who currently hold the keys is obviously up to shady sht the past couple of days
148236,1578089423626960912,of course theyre subject to change as is bank lending precisely why this deal isnt completed yet
148242,1578082332673806336,the deal in totality may be funded how its funded isnt disclosed
148243,1578082164264026114,i dont think this is accurate at all
148253,1578022242239516673,that manufacturing lyfe lol

148255,1578018103778168835,also pairs up with arks recent tsla buy
148256,1578017856276647938,elon sells ahead of time i think hes sold and loaded up for the twitter buy already explains tsla volumes
148262,1578003357091913728,would explain so little info on X plans
148267,1577921544999022592,it was a move for control of oilenergy yes 100 that will be the start of every war from today fwd which is stupid because the sun is literally laughing at our dumb asses
148271,1577902633779707904,the right to exist
148272,1577901914007769088,i give Biden credit to the extent he has anything to do with our response never back down from those that threaten the existence of humanity kicking the can down the road is dumb imo
148273,1577901004468666368,sometimes you have to punch the bully in the nose we dont even have to hit him we just have to defend an idea
148274,1577900651488677888,Ukraine can defend its boarders we can assist or not Putin isnt launching nukes in an endgame scenario were playing into his hand with any sign of weak rhetoric
148275,1577900148360880128,my concern is Putin from day 1 threatened nuclear proliferation weve been at that level of danger since that day and ive said it from day 1 we have to make a stand to that type of behavior or the world goes to poop on a downward slope why are we just now concerned
148276,1577896583475200000,are you saying nukes are imminent or ground war where do millions of deaths come from in your mind
148277,1577893680735830016,jfc twitter algos are broke AF 😬
148280,1577874937884426241,its almost like they dgaf rn 🤣

148291,1577700631191732227,if you also want to know more about X please RT this 👇so  can see we want to know more 🙏
148292,1577699480681566213,ser it has a name it is doge
148298,1577669317143011330,it needs to be clear what the end goal is tesla has an excellent path thats spelled out clearly what many see rn is nothing because X hasnt been clearly defined he doesnt have to care about share price he does need to communicate better if he intends to use tsla shares
148299,1577668071929544708,concerning X what is the product
148301,1577665277373943808,this simply isnt enough information i would love for  to flesh out X for everyone
148302,1577664965535744001,tesla recently thanked its retail investors for their overwhelming presence and support if new investors have no clear idea whats next you have to understand their confusion
148303,1577664558805696512,youre in a situation where you may be asking lenders for funds to buy an app if nobody understands the basic path forward especially in this environment its hard to see lenders supporting this worries tesla investors thats honesty with no ill intent people want to know
148304,1577663859665633281,if you could explain X even abstractly to us it would go a long way is X app going to be an interface in vehicles is it a payment portal is it a system geared towards space travel or earth livingits difficult to understand something so vague help normies understand
148308,1577467237145141248,dang it play by my rules
148314,1577432337121697792,i KNEW it they were all in on it from the beginning

148318,1577390211125972992,unaware of the Zero government
148322,1577379949731876864,its a joke but even then
148325,1577379281084289025,what if elon shuts down twitter and just uses all twitter compute space for  mining 👀

148344,1577318952652488707,not to mention its clear war is on elons mind feels like some things are being put on hold these are all things elon has eluded to
148345,1577318049434173440,but elon wont pump the stock i think thats the hold up
148346,1577313462887260162,its easy you got this 👇                                     🖲
148348,1577308944523042823,less words more vote
148349,1577308803267284993,i like polish sausage therefore it would be biased of me to include Poland please vote based on options because this is extremely scientific
148350,1577308233282338821,you trust government on some level the poll is a very simple exercise dont lose sleep over it just answer based on your experience
148351,1577306740160438272,omg we actually need nfts now f me
148352,1577306396781068289,thats an illogical answer based on the question lol
148353,1577305633501634561,there is no third option imo these are the most involved parties any other country would have a bias towards getting something in return and add additional complexity  this poll is just an indicator and helps us understand which potentially develops a voting process
148354,1577303929162973186,if were asking who to trust a vote process to lets find out what the people think
148355,1577303412986839040,which government do you trust more maybe  should RT
148364,1577264378717474816,I dont want to drag him hes getting news thru the bs filter like everyone else takes some diligence to verify before you form an opinion
148365,1577263786058469377,like this guy who ive been following for ukraine news on the ground you cant make this stuff up lol he deleted it immediately people give anon accounts sht but if a checkmark means i cant say what i want then what good is that
148366,1577261678127124481,Ukraine troops  civilians appreciate the help at least thats all that matters
148367,1577261181915770880,so now elon sending terminals is badsounds like a shitty takeaway because it is
148368,1577257526722109440,even white collar checkmarked  professionals on here cant dish out some respect for how he operates sort of cringe to watch
148369,1577257153395822592,he has zero fear of failure  publics perception his operating ceiling doesnt exist because of this and most people cant process this respectfully
148380,1577234195692544000,solving fast food general intelligence is insert elon magnitude of multiplier easier than vehicle operation AI
148381,1577229571669512192,do you agree and if so are you open to working with fast food industry to overlay this gameplan to Optimus
148383,1577228328469090305,nobody wants to work at a fast food restaurant my data point is your latest fast food experience is making a robot Optimus to do the job that boomers kids arent doing anymore it isnt difficult to map this out if tesla gets it right
148399,1577039226855559168,and i acknowledge elons big heart its a difficult discussion but that difficulty pales to the reality of whats happening irl
148400,1577038731940626433,im becoming more convinced that the best solution is within Russia the people must demand a better outcome im afraid that is the most peaceful solution albeit unlikely
148401,1577017982446088192,the hard line is literally peoples right to free will and escape from oppression Putins recent comments on the west make this abundantly clear
148402,1577017186262319106,im afraid its all set up at this point no one asked for it but western leaders etc have done the calculating and it is time to make a hard line with Russia is what it is nobody wants death
148403,1577016491966275584,i think what many have issue with here is its already war  Russia wont even give the carnage the respect of calling it war and to bend any further to the Russian leadership narrative is to lend credibility to anything theyve done up until this point
148404,1577013382959751168,its basically the entire point of everything rn
148405,1577013108106633216,elon Russias leadership doesnt want the UN anywhere near their borders surely you can see the issue with your proposal here
148409,1576974947452588033,gotta address the southern oil that was the point of the invasion all along called that day one
148425,1576823573326737409,HES FUCKING TRYING THO
148442,1576752332406411264,imagine being a funder of a robotics Co not named Tesla after this happens not to be too harsh but theres only one way into the TSLA game these days well 2 work there andor own stock
148451,1576662222037995520,im still wearing underwear 😌
148452,1576662039300567041,we made it lol

148478,1576109703368937472,shit just hit the point where i have no idea what theyre talking about  🥲
148483,1576105101777047552,they did all of this in 68 months lolliterally progressing robotics a halfcentury in 6 months thats crazy
148484,1576095544241332229,Full Self Thriving 🔥 its pretty solid 👌
148486,1576094150122143744,s whereass are the best whereass lmao finally home and 25 minutes in to s AI Day presentation im shocked Optimus walks already FST Thriving automatically makes Optimus the most advanced piece of robotic tech ever assembled
148487,1575943449890934784,i hope elon is late i have evening plans
148492,1575900135619338240,looks like 10 fingerswe getting 10 toes
148493,1575899630826446848,me and my Optimus having our first handshake
148495,1575898932085149696,the upper flight deck is massive one could live there for quite awhile
148496,1575898325479755782,will they be covered in a fleshy material 👀
148500,1575873750008201216,its so simple lol
148537,1575508798764191744,battery packs are water proof 👍
148550,1575316958320402432,it happens in the blink of an eye your entire life can change or be over it doesnt have to be like this anymore
148579,1574986136060977152,it would make sense Optimus would be doing a demonstration fit for factory processes at AI Day 2022 not so sure why theyd put him in a car just yet
148580,1574985359137468416,also i want to know if were buying Optimus shoes or rubber soles as they wear gotta have grip
148581,1574984830403588096,Optimus as a bench test rig to show off human interaction more than physical attributes if they have Opty walking impressively ill sell a kidney for more tsla on the following monday
148591,1574898726639964160,did you have an accident 😅
148608,1574761348835205120,and apple brought everyone north
148609,1574761022522630144,its the china news alone the second the twitter news hit the wire tsla dipped with algos
148646,1574457328526831616,imagine semitruck owner operators utilizing Optimus as a travel companion could help in many situations over the road
148647,1574456701855711234,would be cool to see the semi at AI Day 500 mile range semi ships soon
148654,1574388023327969281,OG Tesla investors hate AI day because theyre generally shortterm holders at this point AI day goes over analysts heads and results in uncertainty for 12 month estimatestheir silence on twitter is deafening lol  prove em wrong
148667,1574233506376466435,the origins of this are just the dumbest lmao
148669,1574233019170410498,may own 🤣 but i own 👀 and thats the way its staying rocket man
148715,1573994948214530048,if i had one hangup about owning tsla right now it would be the reality that a possible not probable imo world war has played in to some of s business decisions its not that investors havent calculated this just seeing it in writing twitter deal discovery
148722,1573828829860200449,Optimus v69 will present him with his medal in 2069 on the surface of Mars
148723,1573822122668990465,i want to know the level of excitement i need to bring to AI Day 2022 🤷‍♂️
148724,1573821867210719240,hasnt said much about Optimus latelyplease pump the robot elon 🙏
148729,1573749297732063232,i saw this pic earlier never saved a pic so fast lmao
148734,1573689498709417984,is it time to revise the charter that empowers the chairman and governors of the federal reserveif they dont have the interest of the people in mind or are too blind by alternative influencemaybe
148739,1573634999068360704,powell probably miraculously wakes up by the midterms 🙄
148751,1573334678605627393,factory suspension looks like it handled the drop well
148773,1573028148345815044,I first read about china sea stuff in pop mechs lol weird
148828,1580078697888874499,My dad used to brag his satellites flew faster than the SR71
148830,1580035248116486144,Dont want the wires to dangle
148831,1580026774942908416,Neural Radiance Fields What are they for Porn and catsI heard that at a SXSW keynote once
148832,1580026629824258048,Id put 1000 down on them without even seeing them It wouldnt be the first time Ive done that with  and
148833,1580026391961083904,Shit I should have set up a referral link
148834,1580025707068944384,Id spend the 500000 and do some RD on future scents Antidote comes to mind If you have both youll get in the VIP area Now off to find something that makes people sexier smelling with that 500K
148835,1580025048823316480,Maybe a party you have to wear it to The worlds worst smelling partyI threw one of those at CES tons of fun
148836,1580022341651730433,There is our answer 500000 worth in a few minutes Wait until  announces AI Hallucinators that make your Cybertruck way more fun
148875,1579884430348255232,It isnt true  already debunked this
148924,1579593110405132288,Smart people inside building the rockets
148952,1579531510021263360,No I woke up late
148986,1579361022548541440,Whenever I met him he was
148998,1579332097646657539,Explain please how LIDAR will improve this
148999,1579331266125922305,It is inferior Not needed You compensated by a LIDAR company to spout bullshit like that
149018,1579313786074591232,He didnt tell me anything secret So why would he be fired
149027,1579260985679888384,He does his own tweets
149041,1579240138424451072,I am not compensated by anyone at the moment and never have been compensated by  or any of his companies like Tesla So nice try
149042,1579230170807881728,Anyone who says false is either lying or is ignorant Neither look is good
149044,1579209198931353601,Now go to YouTube and post a gas vehicle catching on fire too They are far far far far more dangerous and catch on fire far far far far more often
149045,1579208964834701313,Humans kill 40000 every year in USA They must be banned
149047,1579188607113306112,The Tesla is way safer in such a wreck than ANY gas car
149048,1579188174970290176,No But it is fun
149049,1579187361732505601,Man my phone is blowing up this morning with friends writing me Did you know  replied to youIt used to be only the BBC had this effect
149051,1579178486391967744,It floats without doing that
149052,1579178083638464513,In next three months
149054,1579174467141398528,That isnt how things work Which is why he was laughing
149055,1579174239529480193,Since I have owned Tesla it has gone down 50 six times So it is expected
149056,1579167828854599681,Designed to make it hyper quiet inside
149059,1578970008360976384,I would buy any glasses  sells Or really anything
149063,1578964105758932992,We could do well by copying European cities No argument there But most of America isnt cities So trucks owned in most places Fords mostly
149065,1578960521726160896,Did you know it is far easier to make one than a Ford F150 and that they are as efficient as my Model 3 The way they make them is far far far superior to any other vehicle So maybe you are barking up the wrong tree
149067,1578958634658066434,Thanks Now since I was on your show am thinking of a puppy for my frunk
149069,1578957476783087621,Do you get the damage oil does when burned Far far far greater
149071,1578956126842138625,My house is more efficient than my neighbors even with my Tesla in the mix
149072,1578955616869289984,In my cars battery Soon with extra batteries
149074,1578955014688870400,I get my power out of the sky for free You are welcome to try to beat that with some other method
149077,1578951874056663040,Everyone will get it around the end of the year
149080,1578950712800989185,Again much more sustainable moving oil all over the world and burning it
149084,1578948213083492354,That is no longer true You really need to come to the factory and see the quality lately Casting machines are FAR FAR FAR better than other tech for building vehicles
149085,1578947602887847938,My energy comes via solar panels in the roof Yours pollutes far far more
149086,1578947381189484544,It is when people have looked into it How many hands have to dig oil out of the ground
149087,1578946602521067520,If you are a billionaire you already have one of these toys
149088,1578946148102189057,No need to Someone is designing a propeller for the tow hitch
149095,1578942075239690241,Better than doing that in a gas vehicle
149100,1578938441496408064,It will be amazing once FSD really gets done Will take you on thrill rides s  took me around the track in the pace car The roadster will be better than him
149103,1578936487659257856,For everyone who bought FSD I am guessing that is Christmas gift
149104,1578936258751262720,It can be I am told
149106,1578931433061900288,Lets not go too far
149107,1578930986619834369,That is what they did
149110,1578930252612456449,Last night I met an electrical engineer who is working at Tesla He was effusively positive about his employer He laughed about the Cybertruck being able to float “If  says it on Twitter we gotta build it”
149184,1578248424083726336,It takes you for drives Agree But you are crazy too and keep that
149218,1578152914840756225,It is true People dont understand software They understand hardware because they can touch it Something the software people exploit My Sonos is dramatically better today than when I bought it thanks to software Same with Tesla
149226,1578116143130152960,Here is why  your government is trying to protect its automakers but failing
149245,1578052392632754176,He has Google Translate I used it to talk with people at Shanghai Disneyland Worked great
149318,1577904089463402496,If I had a bigger budget and a new home that doesnt have solar I would do the Tesla roof and batteries My friend had that and it rocks Tesla should buy Span and integrate
149321,1577902462060695553,And yes I have a picture of the first prototype hanging on a wall at University of Illinois It only mentions Martin But ask yourself would we have gotten from here to where we are today without Elon Hell no
149323,1577900483276070912,We were in serial model
149324,1577900383376183298,Elon showed me Teslas first car No one else did The idea that Elon didnt start Tesla is laughable
149331,1577891968545587201,The computer tracks all that And if it goes into blind spot doesnt it know the child is there the same way you do How do you deal with blind spots
149338,1577865094028963840,It knows what is there Or will in a future update Nothing gets into blind spot without camera seeing it
149366,1577753626679787520,EVERYTHING will be tracked in the future The new architecture allows for that AR systems are being built to do just that kind of tracking There are AIs that see guns hidden under clothes
149368,1577752547355283457,Not finished that way today But the computer science is there
149369,1577752108589150208,Yes now that we are on a voxelbased architecture where EVERYTHING is tracked it can track a human leaving something in front of the car
149371,1577749377149345792,Actually it doesThe camera cant see it But the world in front of car hasnt changed since last time it was imaged Now if you say a human changes the environment that can be tracked too even if not seen
149372,1577749239999758338,The current architecture can track all things going to and from the blind spot So if you take something that can damage the car even if you keep it under jacket AI can see that and track that
149373,1577748991436984320,Yes it does My car goes through very very very narrow spaces It even folds in the mirrors to do so All with vision
149374,1577748020862472192,The church is in charge of our Supreme Court That is far far far far far more worrying than Trump at this point
149375,1577747159683715072,They dont jump around anymore in FSD 69
149376,1577747047179919360,It isnt finished yet so cant be judgedHumans are still part of the solution Five years from now they wont beThe system today works on building a 3D environment around the car and tracking everything It doesnt do U turns either It will
149380,1577723572142804992,Yes My cameras are always running So it will see a kid getting in front of the car and know the kid is still there even if the kid cant be seen by cameras anymore
149381,1577723418878758912,It doesnt matter on my car Unless Im going to leave it not charging at an airport for weeks And that wont happen for long Five years from now itll just drive itself home and hook back up to my charger
149383,1577721648987262976,My cameras are ALWAYS running Sentry mode sees EVERYTHING near the car ALWAYS
149384,1577721435769839616,Sensors are not features Driving is a featureTeslas head of AI explains how it works
149385,1577721191837466625,Yeah Teslas head of AI explains how it works
149386,1577721019598446592,Yes Teslas head of AI explains how it works
149387,1577720941420769280,Yes Teslas head of AI explains how it works
149388,1577720654303875073,Way beyond vector space Vector space is what it shows the human The way it works inside is voxelbased now on FSD 69 or newer
149389,1577720415778066432,No sensors needed other than cameras to make this 3D scene Now what happens if something jumps into a blind spot Well the AI predicts every moving objects next action Even one it cant see well anymore It knows it is there in the 3D scene around the vehicle
149390,1577719803938152448,It made a Neural Radiance Field of everything a 3D scene So it knows where everything is Why It is driving through a 3D scene The wall road floor and other obstacles doesnt move The AI already knows that and knows that a kid on a bicycle is something else to track
149396,1577519326822703105,Steve Jobs stole the Mac from Xerox So
149397,1577489587777118208,I bet the next time we see the robot it has more than 1000 skills
149398,1577487961884884995,It all worked out
149400,1577486123663646720,The robot redundancy will greatly reduce error rate So great getting to hang out with you Dream achieved
149401,1577485778552205313,Humans kill 40000 in cars in USA every year and you want me to touch the machine
149416,1577461336673374208,Its possible Since its possible it is probable Just need  to think of it
149447,1577448537289129984,He probably would say such a system is an improvement over the luckbased system we used to have
149460,1577416879815393280,Not true I know Googlers who say Tesla is the one You mean on the Waymo team Of course not
149463,1577415051186577408,Meanwhile I sit in science fiction I never thought I would see
149465,1577414005877972992,Yes My car was one of the first made before they had any data Just charged more because it was more expensive
149466,1577413355861467138,When I interviewed Fords head of safety he told me they instrumented a bunch of cars and learned that 80 of humans when in accidents have not applied full braking pressure So you should be more worried about when I am driving than when the car is
149467,1577410874951618565,I just drove 1000 miles on brand new Audi in UK It isnt nearly as safe as Tesla Not as fun
149468,1577410441977864192,Their problem It isnt nearly as smooth now as safe if they did

152488,1580518220641234947,I view my role as to provide balance and present all potential outcomes ahead   not just the favorable ones Every time I bring up that Elon may have to raise additional equity you complain  yet its a very high possibility Please follow someone else if you just want positive

152490,1580465690569412608,Its not just the equity overhang that makes TWTR a bad deal for TSLA shareholders Its the ongoing 12B and mounting annual int expense that  will cough up on 13B new debt against a TWTR business that now has negative free cash flow

152493,1580308427632390144,burnt hair fragrance offering on TWTR is brilliant Hes already sold 10000 bottles at 100bottle He is demonstrating to existing and potential 3P TWTR equity investors the immense power of TWTR in marketing new products  even seemingly bizarre ones tsla
152496,1580242522097319936,TWTR risk is short term risk related to Elon funding the TWTR deal and how much funding he needs to raise  I dont see Elon owning TWTR as increasing TSLA China risk I worry far more that Elon will need to put in more funding his distraction and loss in EV share of voice

152529,1579848240929067008,I voted no because as an American citizen Elon has a right to express his political views however he wants  Also Id much rather Elon try to solve an important problem like world peace than tout crypto
152537,1579758041515192322,Slightly above lowered Sept expectations following last weeks 3Q delivs  need to compare to Sept production and see how much went into China inventory Not a demand issue more likely a pricing issue
152544,1579618063074619392,Whats the biggest obstacle to transforming TWTR
152586,1579153856373886976,Stop hating  Elon can do what he wants with his cash Im just explaining why TSLA went down 16 last week and preparing investors for more sales
152595,1578942304924024832,Guess well see Im sure TWX thought the same about AOL
152596,1578934793974460416,If Elon built an American WeChat from scratch it could work  But taking TWTR and transforming it into WeChat seems a bridge way too far   With 10x debtEbitda
152597,1578899851445932032,Thats true  But up until recently Elon used margin against his shares for cash flow rather than sell shares because hed have to pay taxes
152599,1578788756035076097,TSLA mgmt should explain their 4Q production vs delivs plan as it relates to 1 smoothing out qtr end delivs 2 US EV credit 3 China 3Q deliv falloff as consumers waited for price cut May be legit reasons for 4Q production to again exceed delivs

152642,1578195263788707840,Well see  Engineering expertise vs ad business expertise With very diff cultures
152644,1578171598774870026,Awesome  How many and  what price  We need more EV news Elon
152651,1578121608618573824,One is not like the other  TSLA SpaceX Boring and Neuralink are all engineering and tech driven  TWTR is an ad business which Elon hates
152656,1578093142704009216,I do But he should use every ounce of flexibility he has to get out  if he can
152657,1578090627874668544,TWTR talks to end the litigation are reportedly stuck over Elons contingency that he receive the 13B in debt financing committed  The debt facility is being lead by Morgan Stanley and shared by 7 banks including MS  Odds remain high this gets resolved
152659,1578073753749168131,Congrats on TSLA investment grade credit rating  Separately on TWTR Will you have to sell more TSLA stock to close the deal at 5420
152669,1578016410193874944,With  ‘s depo now pushed off Elon has more bargaining power than he thinks He gave TWTR SHs a huge gift by agreeing to pay 54share for an asset worth 30share if he could walk away There is still a very small chance of a CStype event that freezes credit markets
152670,1577999916294721538,Buying TWTR and turning it into an American version of WeChat would be like buying Toyota and turning it into an EV manufacturer  would be better off building it from scratch
152679,1577812045281599488,Why not build a WeChat app from scratch rather than pay 44B for a broken botridden adv platform At 54share TWTR sells for 60x 2023 EPS  Tencent sells for 17x 2023 EPS
152680,1577810934432686082,Value added services made up 53 of Tencent Revs in 20222Q  Just 14 came from online advertising
152682,1577807466674491394,For those still confused Apollo Global and Sixth Street werent part of the  debt facility either Their noninterest is irrelevant tsla twtr
152683,1577806829144391682,The debt consortium doesnt include them either
152684,1577804720206397440,My only point WeChat started as an everything app and is only now adding advertising  TWTR started as an Adv platform and with 10x FY23 DebtEbitda after Elon takes control cant just magically transform itself to an everything app Lets be real
152687,1577799590027337731,Theres a lot of nonsense talk about Apollo Global and Sixth Street being no longer interested in financing  bid for TWTR  Neither entity was part of the 71B in 3rd party equity financing announced on 54 so their noninterest is irrelevant
152688,1577793344196968448,Heres the Elon Musk Project X bank commitment letter Its pretty ironclad
152690,1577783939028197377,Agree  130B bank financing commitment seems pretty iron clad  What would allow banks to pull out
152691,1577766186707783696,TSLA likely to underperform as long as  stays mum about whether he has to sell more TSLA shares That said if banks pull the plug on 125B debt needed Elon can walk away and pay a 1B termination fee  In that case TSLA jumps 510 and TWTR crashes to mid30s
152695,1577743369727623200,And I thank you But its a very small
152696,1577741497335791631,Tencent WeChat Weixin is clearly the model WeChat makes up 60 of Tencent MAUs and Valueadded services gamesother services generate 54 of Tencent revenues IMO TWTR can add revs from valueadded services but I doubt you can convince many TWTR users to pay monthly fees
152716,1577632654530211840,Thanks for the thought  need to grow FFND past 100M
152721,1577456910818631680,Elon can only sell TSLA shares if he previously entered into a 10b51 trading agreement before the TSLA trading window closed around 916
152723,1577454952078680065,Carl Icahn and several large hedge funds are the big winners if the TWTR deal closes Icahn bought shares in the high30s in recent months and stands to make 250M Other hedge fund winners who bought TWTR include Third Point LLC and DE Shaw TSLA
152727,1577413647021723648,I still think its a mistake for Elon to buy TWTR Hes an engineer with a tech focus TWTR is an ad company and Elon loathes advertising Elon had no choice but to close given the courts procontract view of the case and their ability to take TSLA shares if he loses
152736,1577367226612518912,If  were to tweet that he doesnt need to sell more TSLA shares to close the deal we est 25B additional may be needed either because he has other sources or more 3P equity and hes prepared to close next week TSLA could jump 510 as the TWTR overhang lifts
152738,1577363830170157057,can close this deal in a week if he tweets those two famous words  “Funding secured”  Meaning no additional funds needed tsla twtr
152747,1577337169638821888,Must feel great to avoid a day of dep prep and two days of ridiculous questions by Wachtell Lipton  Lifes too short tsla twtr
152755,1577318526750187520,The other issue is timing of the SP upgrade  My bet TSLA will wait until SP upgrades its debt to investment grade before they announce a buyback
152756,1577317600299728898,With returns on cash 2yr TY above 4 buybacks at 40x Street 2023 earnings are actually dilutive 25 return on 2023 EPS On an IRR basis which is how the TSLA Board should look at this buybacks are clearly accretive on my 2026 EPS of 2080 PE  122x  82 return
152766,1577092566121467904,Not at all  Just think there is a cause Chinese consumers waiting for a deal and effect exporting out excess inventory  tsla
152798,1576530999684390914,Not estimatable until theres a working Optimus for which one can estimate the value added benefits
152800,1576327492289564672,See my tweets from this morning No change in models or PTs
152801,1576327241885446144,And thats paid off well so far  As I said I invest with my eyes wide open
152802,1576321492752551936,TSLA is and has been our largest position by far In investing I like to keep my eyes wide open  Many here just trust whatever Elon says
152809,1575907527325368330,Reuters isnt forecasting 3Q and TSLA wont guide for 4Q
152818,1575625333977788418,Wrong Even if I include 630M unvested RSUs as of 630 additional equity needed is 630M x 5420  34B  The 44B est includes Elons 73M shares already owned  If the deal closed tomorrow at 5420 Elon would need 20B for existing shares plus 34B for RSUs twtr tsla
152821,1575570352948015104,2 Even if  loses the TWTR trial would more likely settle at 5152share Elon would only have to raise 23B more from TSLA sales raised 15B equity to fund the equity needed to complete the deal assuming the 7B 3P equity and 13B debt financing still intact
152828,1575493629556453377,Im still shocked that no one on the TSLA board or exec team pushed back on Elon when he decided to go after TWTR TWTR is very unlike SpaceX and Boring which are engineering and tech driven TWTR is an ad business which is not Elons thing
152834,1575232514444398593,Always remember…Im a huge TSLA bull
152835,1575232215486955523,Im sure it will be fine  TSLA ‘s EV business has tremendous momentum
152836,1575229805959991296,I would prefer to see someone who will push back on Elon when hes wrong Larry was that guy
152837,1575228870814740480,Great…another friend of Elons on the TSLA Board
152862,1574760380097765378,deposition rescheduled for Oct 67  That delay plus strong China weekly registrations 231K vs 159K prior week is likely reason for TSLA relative strength today
152871,1574512293739651076,From what I read Parag sought to delay his depo first with Alex Spiro and Elon then followed
152875,1574488339239125043,Why wouldnt they have known this last week or even this morning twtr tsla
152880,1574473761361113088,I dont agree with  take on this Tomorrows hearing likely not nearly as important to Elon as AI Day 2 and qtrend delivs at TSLA Could imply a settlement is being negotiated but could also be just a very busy week for TSLA and  Something had to give
152887,1574384434643705856,Yes pieces come out at trial
152888,1574375696843116549,TSLA community on TWTR is not an unbiased sample
152900,1574120846066696193,You mean 5 to each person
152924,1574023421087944706,said buybacks were on the table at the AGM
152925,1574023034595414023,TSLA will generate 170B free cash flow between 20222026   and I have both tried to push management to consider buybacks rather than let cash build up   said at the annual meeting that buybacks were on the table
152929,1573731836806791170,Many here including Elon judging from his texts seem to confuse mDAUs which have known bots and spam already removed and accounts
152930,1573730525180723203,Im very calm  Im also realistic
152931,1573730425767329797,Elon will lose if he takes this to trial since this court will side with deal certainty unless Elon can prove that TWTR knew that bots are more than 5 mDAUs  a much higher bar than 5 of DAUs and that rises to the level of an MAE Mudge may not know anything about mDAUs
152947,1573335825659592709,Of course they are going to say that  But at the end of the day TWTR has a Board that doesnt want to be sued
152948,1573333859621552131,He could also file a fraud claim against TWTR in federal court
152949,1573331554402795520,Yes but the alternative is that if Elon loses he can appeal it to DE Supreme Court and ultimately US Supreme Court and that would take months if not years for this to be resolved Meanwhile TWTRs business is on hold
152979,1572929053572612096,Busy week for  next week  Depo by Wachtell Lipton in TWTR trial Mon Tue and maybe Wed and AI 2 Day Friday All while leading  TSLA efforts to deliver Teslas for 3Q qtrend delivery wave  Somewhere Id rather be
153009,1572344563066638338,What doc is this passage from
153015,1572240742294196225,Elon Musk is the defendant not TWTR
153025,1571952604208594945,I dont doubt Elons vision at all  I just think Elon buying TWTR is analogous to TSLA buying  Huge distraction loss in share of voice overvalued at 5420
153028,1571941859441909760,The Fed is headed down the wrong path by raising rates aggressively to fight a supplydriven inflation caused by Covid which has already peaked The Fed is making the mirror image mistake it made in 2021 allowing rates to stay low for too long by pushing up rates too fast now
153030,1571897925285937152,As Ive said previously thats like an 80year old woman walking into a beauty salon with a picture of Kim Kardashian and telling the stylist to make the woman look like Kardashian TWTR wont get users to pay fees Its very diff than energy transport and space
153037,1571872499553521672,The autonomous driving market seems to be separating into two distinct segments 1 ADAS driver assist that make driving easier  but where the driver is always in control and 2 AV robotaxi where the vehicle drives itself with no human intervention The latter costs  more
153041,1571741225027506177,To win at trial Elons legal team first has to prove that TWTRs estimate that 5 of dMAUs is false  not that 5 of MAUs is false which is far more definitive My understanding is mDAUs are at least 10 lower than DAUs Hopefully everyone here knows the difference
153042,1571739358461313027,Im sure Elon doesnt want to get fd over Im also sure TWTR knows that more than 5 of DAUs are bots But thats very diff from saying more than 5 of mDAUs are bots TWTR reduces DAUs for fakespam accounts it identifies to est mDAUs TWTR clearly caveats this estimation
153078,1570819862997663744,Worth a read  great profile by  of DE Chancery Judge Kathaleen McCormick who will decide whether  has to buy TWTR at 5420share next month
153093,1570705427406663680,The Fed sits in its own little world ignoring Americas CEOs like TSLA ‘s  and Starwoods Barry Sternlicht and continues to inflict huge economic damage by raising interest rates massively to fight a Covidsupply driven inflation that is already largely in retreat
153124,1570144861134749696,Good podcast summary by  on TWTR vs  case to date
153125,1570138412807757826,Sounds like a future TSLA commercial
153145,1570000049337257989,Heres core PPI which is a leading indicator CPI is a lagging indicator
153146,1569999429561712642,Look at it over 2 years like you would a company  Inflation was 0 during Covid then soared as the world reopened Looking forward assuming Covid disappears supply and labor pressures will also disappear The Fed is fighting last years war
153147,1569997914121932800,Fed is behind the curve again just as they were last year in the opposite manner
153148,1569997553248223234,Fed is fighting Coviddriven inflation labor and supply shortages Last I looked Covid is in full retreat
153149,1569997123466268673,8 inflation   Thats 11 months of rear view mirror data caused by Covid shortages  But Covid is going away Try MoM x 12 12
153150,1569996289995055104,One month of data  Look at the trend CPI is a lagging indicator  On two year stacked basis Covid in Covid out inflation only 34 annualized and clearly coming down
153152,1569987492937449472,Youre confusing TSLA price and value as usual
153153,1569987056818069504,Youre conflating price and value  TSLA worth 550share but TWTR overhang one reason value cant be realized
153154,1569982084793470978,Most CEOs with whom we speak say the same The Fed is risking damage to the economy by raising rates to fight inflationary pressures caused by Covid shortages which have peaked Retailers are drowning in inventory housing prices are falling layoffs mounting Fed should pause
153162,1569764672152436736,Lets not conflate price and value
153163,1569758132812877825,If  settles with TWTR at even 52share TSLA likely to rise 510 since risk that Elon has to sell more TSLA shares goes away continued negative news flow around trial ends and TSLA media focus returns to strong momentum in EV business
153165,1569741752172421125,Other companies that present at Goldman conference will post their prepared remarks or presentations online on their IR websites TSLA could do the same
153167,1569731143905296384,TWTR whistleblower Peiter Zatkos testimony didnt offer much to bolster  case that TWTR deliberately misstated the  of bots as  of dMAUs His testimony more painted a picture of incompetence at the top and a company with gaping security vulnerabilities
153202,1569274338699788292,Inflation is already peaking as Covid disappears
153209,1569206962855841792,The Fed is headed down the wrong path by raising rates aggressively to fight a supplydriven inflation caused by Covid that has already peaked The Fed is making the mirror image mistake it made in 2021 allowing rates to stay low for too long by pushing up rates too fast now
153229,1568548433400659969,Let me be clear  Judge McCormick is unlikely to allow Elon to use this argument to get out of the deal Im just suggesting this may help get both sides closer to settling in a case that seems clearly going in TWTR ‘s favor so far
153234,1568465668579930112,Elon could have done all that but he didnt  I warned against him buying TWTR because it was clear it was a colossal mess Why he didnt do more work on it escapes everyone  But you dont get to buy something without diligence and then cry foul because you didnt do the work
153235,1568456944859643905,Your connection of dots skips a couple steps  namely 1 proof that TWTR knew bots were 5 of mDAUs and 2 TWTR hid it  Given the anbiguity of language about bots in the 10K Elon should have insisted on flushing out the  bots before buying TWTR  as DIS did  He didnt
153236,1568451121638678528,To prove fraud one has to show scienter  that TWTR knowingly lied in its financial statements  One cant just show that bots are a high  of mDAUs  One has to prove deceit
153237,1568445894265131009,No Im definitely not saying that and the judge will not agree with that view
153238,1568436731057143809,Fair point  But I still think it was well known that a substantial  of TWTR dMAUs were bots and that with any diligence one would know that And unlike most every one else here I strongly advised against it from before Day 1
153242,1568361025782562816,After the close  filed a third basis for terminating the TWTR merger agreement namely the payment on 628 of 775M severance to whistleblower Pieter Zatko which the Musk team argues violates Section 61e of the merger agreement tsla
153247,1568310145423130624,I am sure he feels he got a good deal
153259,1568254502532415488,Once TWTR shareholders approve 54share price next Tues hard for them to settle for less than 50 tsla

155365,1577859091984179200,FSD Beta was perfect almost every single second today that I dont think an update would have changed a thing Thats how good its getting Its hard to get it to “fail”
155366,1577858457012772864,Alternate routes Tire pressure in app Blind spot camera positioning options Actual smart summon Fsd updates V11 single stack Holy mother
155372,1577837698185822208,Yea sometimes itll slow a little too much to confirm tight spaces What some humans would do but still too passive bc its not measuring perfectly
155373,1577835815136366593,Fsd beta money will easily pay for the twitter acquisition lol
155374,1577827881740378113,Cant wait till they give it to everyone  when can everyone with 80 get it
155375,1577824721521053697,Mine has been really really good at this almost always lately The current problems seem mainly like map data or just being a little extra cautious
155377,1577772484430123008,The left lane turns inches away from fast traffic like chuck cool turn are soooo fucking hard to trust but this version has been pretty stellar Its close to where it needs to be
155378,1577772212907548688,Honestly Id say that my heart rate is now less almost always when fsd is on vs when Im driving and I drive a tonnnnn everywhere and have pretty good track record
155379,1577771952030339074,Theyre pulling our strings Its too powerful to release all at once😂
155381,1577747292936978470,Yea it can vary but Ive learned where its most likely to fail so if I have passengers in car I can quickly turn it off to reduce jerkiness If Im alone I can let it attempt more as long as its safe Overall driving without fsd beta is way harder for me now
155383,1577726347899801631,Yea I mean I think its just at such a comfortable point that the small “easy” problems are so minimal that I feel like I pretty much truly have the FSD product Or at least super super close to it
155385,1577717081289756677,Holy shit I cant even figure out what can be majorly upgraded at this point Anything specific besides high velocity cross traffic prediction improvements

155413,1577168852269797376,Its just relaxing and perfect Im ready for more huge road trips
155417,1577163991516086274,It fails mostly at the most “simple” things for humans but it safe at all times humans fail Human brains are still really capable in bizarre ways The “semantics” throw the robot off
155418,1577161523306573824,Its so good overall I think most tesla owners dont even know what theyre missing but will find out with free trial next year 🤞
155419,1577160227958362112,But 99 of rides are so smooth now love it
155420,1577160160530771968,FSD was awesome most of the time today except its still trying to run red lights at 40 mph that literally show red on the screen  safety critical red light bugs

155499,1576426205251006464,You think tons will subscribe once it gets a bit better goes wide and goes viral
155500,1576423254289285121,NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE BUT ROBOTS WILL TAKE OVER

155504,1576364192579211264,Will we see FSD Beta 10693 this week
155507,1576287207853215744,Haha even I was falling asleep and I loved it I hope dojos efficiencies and more fsd beta testers can make the system improve exponentially right after wide release no safety score or anything Seems like it should if they have the right architecture
155508,1576272518838595584,FSD drives like a super calculated “nerd” It shows how impatient and unsafe and stupid most humans really are
155509,1576083000990715904,My 2012 Honda accord has been driving by itself for 10 years I get drunk and hop in the backseat all the time Elon is a big showtime scammer

155511,1576055345453371392,Someone plz ask about single stack
155513,1576038997775699968,FSD Beta is fucking awesome
155527,1575699148657299456,Same lol felt like it got worse all of a sudden Results may vary
155538,1575508028530507778,Elon you know theyre all trolling right Anything possible to slow down tesla while everything else collapses around it
155546,1575181872514371585,Alright just dont use it if its bothering you so much
155547,1575180677682987008,Had you waited and not disengaged Im almost 100 sure it was going to follow the guy and then properly go left… you took over probably a millisecond before it corrected itself and wouldnt have been unsafe to wait that extra time
155548,1575179627860934657,And its these morons who are at fault in accidents Not FSD Beta What if someone was crossing the street on that left turn the guy behind you wouldnt even see bc he just made the right hed nail right into you bc of close following
155549,1575178848609521664,None of these are safety critical at all
155550,1575178765667569665,Youre being way too critical and not seeing how difficult driving safely really is You also took over at the left right after a right bc the “guy behind you” He can be patient just like you…
155551,1575178557235793920,It hesitated bc this guy just came into sight and we have to make sure hes not going to run the light or turn right in front of us Also no one was to your right so it swung out further Wouldnt have done that if a car was there
155552,1575175982516174854,My absolute most critical issue which could be deadly if driver isnt paying attention is it still appears itll run a red light at 40 mph with completely blind cross traffic too Ive tried so hard to let it go and see if itll stop but it just doesnt do it in time
155553,1575175797408559104,Its not perfect but Ive learned that I was disengaging nervously too early which is almost definitely very common It feels like Ill almost never crash if I dont intervene but most likely to be rear ended
155554,1575175587102355457,Ive had almost 0 failures like this with high sample size Mine fails to go quick enough once light turns red when in intersection waiting
155559,1575171343623942147,Do you get nervous or what do you mean by “struggles”
155564,1575167327309799425,Ive never noticed worse performance ever when it says fsd may be degraded
155565,1575167150033358848,Its just informing you for safetywhy not be safe than sorry
155570,1575025875661516801,This is going to be SO INSANE
155573,1574977062195953665,Think I may have figured it out But after some time I think the tesla should inch up and over to see if no one is there then it knows “ok the truck wasnt waiting for anything”
155574,1574974986653401089,I cant find a single thing different in this case for why it may have decided to not even try passing that truck Its bothering me lol Been trying to figure it out for 20 min
155575,1574973346617298944,Such a confusing thing to figure out lol
155576,1574971342981541888,I cant connect the dots in my own brain on how to define with high enough certainty every time that the car in front of me is in fact parked This seems like the biggest visual illusion to a computer Takes a lot of reasoning it seems
155578,1574968328505786368,same it needs to approach them at a more consistent slower decel speed till it has full view also on windy roads bearing right its too far left for comfort pretty often
155584,1574926739574493184,Due to FSD Betas superhuman like behavior Im starting to finally understand what  means when he recommends that we should find a way to regulate AI
155591,1574902258575319048,I have no hair tho
155592,1574901217591009292,0 intervention for me not for thee 😂
155593,1574898373894832128,Its not perfect but I think its still trying to “understand” certain turning lanes Very weird lol
155594,1574898025675325440,But I dont let it go nearly that far off course in that scenario lol
155595,1574897967592611851,You never know if it would have just 000000001 seconds later
155596,1574897711958171669,Also was the move to make a left at that light ahead
155597,1574897580831645708,Dont let it go that far A few inches at most
155606,1574865035071033346,Always prepare but youll be surprised how good it is over time It takes a lot of time getting used to I think Its a very crazy thing where we have to trust the system in really high risk spots but its really sick Lol
155608,1574857223267880960,As FSD has gotten better any driving without it has become wayyy harder for me FSD is like driving with your brain and you stop it when the brain doesnt closely match the robots Lol its super easy n fun
155609,1574856805397762051,Its driving me Its so good My mom wont even use autopilot but Im nervous because I know that pretty much any accident that could occur would be avoided using this software Its pretty crazy how people brush off self driving Its the most solvable thing
155610,1574854424375205888,Im driving FSD Beta and watching it do unreal things Im almost living the self driving dream Im watching the stock outperform everything Im watching the company grow SO FAST What am I missing
155632,1574626374911934465,Robotaxi The game is over
155633,1574611199454777344,Its suuuper close to this imo Ita mathematically safer for the passenger to bare the sometimes roughness in order to get the highest safety Not crashing isnt that hard But comfortably not crashing is tough Cant be a panic room always
155640,1574513782566494209,Yep its absurd how good its getting
155643,1574382910517436417,Its a killer product today and its getting better I dont even care about driverless That time will come one day and we will enjoy watching from the driver seat for now 😎
155650,1574243116986650624,But then the annoying tiniest percent of edge cases suckkkkkk
155651,1574242922605809664,Yea to be more smooth But its still safe as is Most of the “unsafe” things are random pretty hard stopping bc it randomly thinks a 3 way intersection comes to a stop Happens in weird spots in random neighborhoods etc where people would never do this and can get hit from behin
155652,1574239629909409795,Basically slowing down as long as its not aggressive but also always moving forward without crashing or flying through a red light or stop sign and its nearly fully autonomous everywhere If every car ran current fsd beta no one would ever have to drive again imo
155653,1574239351587979264,It doesnt understand why there isnt a stop sign in some intersection erring on side of safety it clearly can see there is no stop sign but its decision making is off due to it being confused by some clues or bad map data or both But it can almost go anywhere on its own
155655,1574235705664065537,Tesla is delivering a real product The computer is still learning until it has the best data possible it seems It clearly sees so well It just hasnt solved decision making
155682,1574065575550021634,I use it so much and still cant believe its real I believe its getting better rapidly and another step change coming soon is gonna be awesome
155683,1574061220273000451,Its like an illusion As that building came into clear sight it can appear for a millisecond that its moving or blocking your path Can trick human eye in real time too sometimes
155684,1574060856882733060,Looks like this is what tricked it Watch again and youll see Scary lol
155710,1573853841971355651,Lmaoo they AI just cant figure it out Monkey level intelligence lol
155717,1573843521756446727,Dont blow their cover or someone is gonna get in its path and screw it up 😂😂
155719,1573841340034682881,BREAKING THE WHOLE ECONOMY IS BEING REPLACED BY MACHINES
155727,1573768498354028544,Bro all Tesla FSD Beta testers are living in like 2035 in everyone elses minds right now They have NO clue whats going on lol
155728,1573762365316792324,How can any car without FSD be even half as valuable to the average consumer
155735,1573731284471500803,Ive been testing FSD Beta for almost a year now and I can confidently say you have no clue whats going on
155741,1573719129042870273,How many teslas you selling per day lately If its not over 5 youre fired
155752,1573665621929246723,will we step change in map improvements soon
155763,1573524721802612737,Same everyone should spread the word Im gonna do it soon
155768,1573506499883704325,Its not a smart algo but I understand it
155782,1573487640841691140,I think these battery factories going up for other remaining companies will be putting those batteries in “cars” driven by fsd beta If not theyre dead
155783,1573487325090299904,Feel like Ive been put in a Time Machine that is literally speeding up
155784,1573487239828574208,This version did it and I swear its getting better every day idk whats going on lol
155785,1573486879231582237,I never dont want it on The other fkn drivers are the only problem that remains
155786,1573471828277854216,I still cant believe its real
155801,1573434985817964544,Biggest issue is incorrectly thinking a light is green or missing a stop sign Other than thats its really close to something special
155802,1573434842012057600,Nowhere near l4 imo but its by far the best l3 that everyone should arguably have in their cars today
155803,1573434673354756105,Strange This isnt consistent between testers
155804,1573432801105711105,Making the car safely never brake when it doesnt need to is EXTREMELY difficult and they almost nailed it
155805,1573432567180697600,“Very few improvements” It almost never phantom brakes anymore Do you know how hard that is to make happen
155807,1573420157380222989,Just had BY FAR the best fsd beta drive 106922 is INSANITY Thanks
155824,1573352047528886272,Yea youll warm up to it Its wayyyyy smoother now than before so try to imagine that 😂
155847,1573163727213535232,I say “cmon cmon cmon go go go” a lotttt but sometimes I think It will go slow and it goes exactly when I would have and I smile  computer
155848,1573152379301773315,How many times have you hit the curb lol
155849,1573148134586609665,Youll be comfortable 95 after few days  weeks Takes some time and edge cases to learn Its so hard to not intervene sometimes lol
155865,1573068287734607873,Oh and the word ‘car Its going to change to ‘robot soon
155866,1573067959043588096,Yes I was being saracastic  sends me updates over the internet every few weeks to my car so that it can drive by itself better Other car companies are trying to figure out how to maybe sign a contract to get a few materials to make a few cars that NO ONE will want
155867,1573067319634497536,Oh look now twitter is hiding this video lol
155868,1573067157650423810,Lol what are all these responses  your app is filled with TRASH
155869,1573066415888019456,VAPORWARE I want to go to sleep in New York and wake up in my Tesla in Australia or I got scammed
155870,1573066139315347456,Extra safe but its also now not a grandma 247 Is getting closer to really frickin good
155871,1573066019551289347,Haha nah itll driver very close to how you should drive if you want the lowest chance of hitting any object moving or not Itll be extra save You just have to stop it the moment its disconnected its action from your brain
155876,1573064161688682498,You didnt do 100 miles AP yet
155877,1573063901280862208,Yea its tricky bc some people “wait to see what itll do” and if no one is behind you and you let it go down to 0 tesla wont see that you intervened bc you didnt so youd need to hit the cam if you wanna try to help them
155880,1573060487989919745,Yep pretty much main thing is it makes you look like an idiot nearly every drive lol Its a mind game to not take over if you dont have to
155896,1573009873503424518,SMH we live in a meme world lol
155897,1573005050716295170,How does it take them so long to fix Youre literally launching rockets and making cars drive themselves everywhere and this software company cant even block the most obvious thing ever bots GALORE

155900,1572979694365990915,Ugh sounds like many didnt get it because of being on a diff software branch I have faith theyll get it fixed for 10693 Probably another 15 days
155901,1572978368408068108,You have 100 miles on autopilot

155910,1572811355249606656,No Id probably need to not intervene once for like 10k miles of city streets and see it nail like 1000 straight edge cases perfectly and see it avoid psycho drivers perfectly thousands of times so thatll probably be 3 years

157314,1570608538514509825,Women are justifiably concerned about flatout rejecting men they arent interested in Its exactly the “nice guy” types who become incensed angry enraged aggressive wont take no for an answer etc and finally end with “youre a fling ugly slut anyway” Safety first
157318,1570606436245442564,Exactly But this is what most women mean when they say “nice guy” Its confusing people often assume the opposite of a “nice guy” is an asshole It rarely is Its just a guy who doesnt invoke the Sahara desert downstairs
157319,1570604872965443584,Yes but context matters Per my “he was really… nice” example In the romantic context “nice” is a proxy for “I do not feel attracted to this man” Nice guys think if they just prove what a GREAT guy they are women will love them This is whowhat “nice guy” means
157320,1570603912075554816,In this context nice is a proxy for “pleaser” wont stand up for self allows self to be pushed aroundwalked all over uncertain doesnt go for what he wants or get to the point tries to “buy” love eg flowers on the first date avoids necessary conflict etc—a doormat

159529,1579412388503506944,and to especially let go of it within themselvesWar stems from this illusion It cannot be fought it cannot be beaten it must be simply releasedWhich is why when Musk brings upasks about up possible solutions I try to make this point heardPower must be released22
159530,1579411968045506563,I hope my timing isnt bad but I want to take this chance to point out that this is humanitys opportunity to take a deep look into the illusion of power That which seeks conflict to maintainjustify its selfThis is humanitys chance to let go of that  12
159531,1579397638365249536,My compassion to you all Do you know what was hit if you dont mind discussing it too much
159535,1579155882520489984,Haha Go figureBro twitter didnt tell me you replied to my tweet I was getting so many notifications Man Its great to meet you I hope you have a good day and we get to interact on here again some time

159538,1579110657089503233,Nice I like hearing that your employees enjoy working for youyour companiesI know youre probably too humble to show it off but I hope someone gives you credit and lets your employees speak abot their experiences working for youbet they have very positive things to say
159539,1579110051864023042,You cannot choose wrong Follow your heartThe human may look back and think they chose wrong sometimes but all is well in all of creation
159540,1579109719872253958,Oh no not more of these forking puns
159541,1579108991975960576,Just trying to survive holds back so many peoples higher potentialsPeople need to not just survive but to enjoy livingThe joy of existing
159542,1579102721051099143,Im not familiar with this What happened to them Fine jail
159543,1579101514580496385,Human consciousness is getting rid of the old energies right now but power does not want to let go or lose its placeYou cannot fight power merely release it
159544,1579100842678177795,May I suggest bringing up the elephant in the room PowerPower is what is keeping this kind of energy stuck And power seeks conflict to justify its self
159545,1579100271569178625,This war is showing everyone on the planet about power righ now that humanity is engaged inHuman consciousness needs to let go of the illusion of power
159546,1579099935731220481,Do you have any ideas in mind I know you got backlash last time but you defintiely had a positive effect on discussionIts an old consciousness war and winning should not be the verbiage used Think of this as about getting out of the illusion of power
159547,1579097401348214792,What assuming you really want to be involved with this would you be willing to do to help bring peace as best as possibleRemember to be careful but would you consider being involved with meetings between anyoneDo you have contacts close to the parties directly involved
159548,1579095668941295618,I like the path youve been taking right now I think a lot of people trust your judgment with the direction you shifted the discussionYou made good points and I think you should obviously just take it from there but good start But dont forget its not your burden to carry
159566,1578976332385783808,I know you have a lot on your plate and youre probably pretty tired of people asking you to fix something like youre the earths maintainance guy but with X app would you consider having your own search engine functionQuite a few leave a lot to be desiredThanks
159567,1578973160007143424,I understand there are reasons to be upset with and frustrated by humanity but people who hate humanity really just hate themselves
159570,1578821863262027777,They will never take away our freedom of speech But we need to be ready to defend it
159573,1578818283624882177,Things are very chaotic at this time When do you think humanity may start seeing things calm down at the earliest Maybe 15  20 years
159575,1578816269901770753,It is beautiful To watch something akin to this in relation to my own creation one day would be great
159581,1578808498414301185,You did that small sketch with Rainn Wilson rightHe was in a film called The Last mimzy Very interesting Very on point metaphysical themes
159582,1578808322576519168,Are you interested in sketch comedy I know youre into stand up but you might be intereste din looking into some kind of comedic group One with unique energy you know Actually edgy and doing unique stuff
159583,1578805754374795264,Thank you for being dedicated to free speech I hope other people yet see it and realise what theyve been missing out on censoring themselves having to constantly explain themselves and hiding themselvesFree Twitter can help shed light on new potentials for humanity
159584,1578804791580717056,Its crazy Theyre trying to crackdown so hard because whoevers controlling the money knows people are waking upIts the desperate throes of those who are dedicated to maintaining the illusion of powerFreedom is the biggest issue facing the planet right now
159586,1578781884091600896,I look foward to alsoIts exciting to see what happens with someone like him who has his heart set on making a positive differenceI hope he inspires many others and maybe even one of his sons will follow in his footsteps if someone needs to step up to the plate after him
159587,1578781089656868864,Hed have huge amounts of high energy support Even just to show people how someone beloved can make an impact on politicsI think hed only notice a fractional increase in attacks on his person by lying journos and dark money haha
159588,1578779206099800065,Your math is so messed up and youre underestimating how much Moneyman Musk could actually give everyoneDo you workfor him
159589,1578777754333773824,Im praying for this
159590,1578774056639561729,I was just checking out his twitter wondering if hed come back a few days agoWeird timing
159600,1578638978269728768,Youre great Dont worry about others they have no sense of humour sometimes
159602,1578635121573638144,Work from traffic no home
159603,1578634855512182784,Its like th eopposite of flying cars It can add an extra layer to the flow of traffic but its a lot more practicalMaybe people were stuck on what they think the future should look like and not what can easily be brought into the present
159605,1578631954844745728,Maybe he can sense you from the past and this is the tweet that inspired him to help bring your consciousness into this world
159608,1578606521436758016,I know Im not the only one to feel like theyre afraid of free speech for quite a few  obvious  reasonsThis MuskTwitter thing is the first time in my lfie Ive seen a maisntream component of soicety like this  hopefully  falling into the Right hands for once haha
159609,1578605634341441536,Im not sure how close it is maybe its clsoer than we think but in a the future a truck that can literally drive its self without needing a human will deal with a lot of issues such as over working chronic bad sleep fatigue distance from familyhome for truckers etc
159610,1578604317187387392,Thats very understandableListening to your heart is important but doubt can creep inFinding out how to prevent that doubt helps Whatever works for youTrust your intuition Follow your heart but temper it with your mind
159611,1578408974663446528,This kind of design would be good for emergency scenarios but what other things besides say recreation could this kind of thing be used for assuming you get its boatlike capabilities fleshed outI gotta admit its actually kind of funny thinking about it
159614,1578270774892584962,Does nuclear war not excite you Common man these are exciting times
159615,1578270245730799616,I always thought he sounded a little aristocratic
159618,1578268516490563584,When you buy twitter please outline the new ground rulesSo many people are used to the horribly restrictive rule set of twitter right now Theyre waiting to say what they want and may end up saying things that even go against the new rules13
159619,1578253910103687169,Is that whats going onThanks for sharing I got a lil worried
159621,1578051866377981954,Humanity is cleaning house and getting rid of all the old energies that no longer serve us Energies that have been with humanity since the beginningWe will enter a new era around 2070 but we have to release all the old before that Its gonna be dark but it will be worth it
159622,1578050668593819648,Humanity is removing the old energies that no longer serve us but power is one of those energies and it does not like thatYou can see how this creates confusion struggle fear doubt etcThey will sink their claws in when they feel their control over humanity slipping
159623,1578050369384763392,Power seeks conflict to justify its self This is why this UkraineRussia thing is so contentious A huge game of power is going on and so many are being drawn into itIts like a vortex Too many dont realise whats happening
159624,1578050070037270528,Dont let them threaten youTheyre empty threats anyway How many threats are made in geopolitics out of fear that the other side is stronger
159625,1578048844314857473,Youre doing amazinglyI and so many others have your back Thats not an empty promise Whatever you need weve got youYou are helping illuminate the potentials of humanity in these incredibly trying times
159626,1578044379956383744,The left cannae meme
159627,1578044070244802560,Notice how these journalists talk down to ElonThey dont think he should be allowed to have his own thoughts or something Theyre projecting their own fear of their feelingsWhen they tell him the situations gone too far shows their cowardice
159628,1578043080284213248,Why do they insist on talking down to you They act like youre some imbecile that cant take care of himself and shouldnt be responsible for your own thoughtsAre they projecting
159629,1578037908074016768,Everytime with you peopleHeres this doctor in Ukraine and she calls for 300 billion for Ukraine from the US Dont worry where that money goes just know it will defeat Putin
159631,1578031607197630464,Mr Musk Please trust me when I tell you no downvote button pleaseIts unnecessarily negative One of the few things facebook did right early on was not having a dislikedownvote button
159634,1578027876380999682,You kinda love to see it
159636,1578023089841262595,I know you understand potentials and so much energy is already in twitter as potentials that werent unlocked because of Awful management and lack of passion intuition imagination etcIts a crime to have had something like twitter and ultimately do F all with it
159637,1578021650523914242,You need to stay downwind otherwise theyll pick up on your musk
159638,1578007916917190657,Journalists calling people traitorsPray reality doesnt come up on you too fast I doubt youll be able to handle that which you hide from yourself all at once
159639,1578007354381303808,Unlike Im sure the many facets of wisdom you have to share with humanity
159640,1578004969256783872,The UN is not great but Im not sure if youve noticed how much has changed since 1949
159641,1578004721948069888,You got here quick Do you follow Musk with notifications turned on just to comment about how you dont like himI dont think I need to tell you anything that you dont already know regarding your on feelings for yourself here bean
159642,1578004077300285440,Thank you for shedding light on actual solutions instead of choosing one side or another in an age old power struggleIts futile to seek to win this Its been going on for centuries
159643,1577997087383642114,Good morning Mr Musk
159646,1577964003758067714,Very excitingIn a world that seems devided and destracted by the low frequency stuff what Elon does is genuinely excitingA true breath of fresh air
159648,1577956566913142786,You got a problem with people being whiteGo on Say it
159649,1577953138170265601,Hey hey hey Goodbyye
159650,1577952498530516993,haha wow Breaking Elon Musks avid detractors often turn out to be hypocrites
159651,1577951802024423424,So well said Thank you
159654,1577949438949347328,Please look into the Democratrun   MASSIVE spam bot networkI want to help clean up twitter and youll love to see this
159655,1577948226690625537,Theres an obsession with saying everything Elon does is an egotistical endeavour I feel like theyre projecting but I havent seen this kind of thing 1000 times before
159656,1577944538563633153,woah youre badass bro
159657,1577938250257551360,You may find this hard to believe maybe hard to wrap your brain around but this is irrelevantThanks for the agitprop
159660,1577923906337656832,Oh hey Its a  accountBeep boop
159662,1577914920670486530,What are you currently feelingDo you have any deep feelings that are hard to put into words right now
159664,1577909381647466496,Are we gonna have to start calling you Peacekeeper
159665,1577893697433513984,How was it Was everything cordial

159670,1577889576030711808,You could call it the supremist of courts
159671,1577886236215488512,Ive noticed replies are really weird like on a post with over ten thousand likes the first replies have 0 likes Very weirdIts definitely broken intentionally and I hope Musk and whoever his twitter team will be look into that Social media should not be this opaque
159672,1577884782125797376,Dont forget that they censor dissenters already so theyre just projectingThey know what theyre doing but if they can no longer secretively get away with it they blame others for what theyre doing
159675,1577874177268527105,Yes One of the few things Im excited for because of thatSo many other social media companies run thei sites like jails and have no idea what social media is about I doubt they even know how to socialise outside of champagne evetns or whatever
159676,1577678388906844162,Please dont talk with certainty on things you dont know
159677,1577678211932393472,I think the energy for this stuff is good it should keep it pure I think Musk has a good grasp on this and with dedication it should keep bad actors at bayWhat does he think might happen
159679,1577633873844129792,Mr Musk can you look into the NFT botsThey mass like peoples ai art and I have a theory theyre taking it to use for their own projectsReally scummy if trueThank you for any consideration
159686,1577606764887166976,I just want to be one of those to call it in case anything happens after Elon buys twitter theres gonna be some serious bullshitTwitter is now was a MASSIVE democrat bot farm and they wont be happy losing that psyop programming machine
159687,1577569693812293632,Just for those curious can you please release the amount of bots you end up purging from twitterSome analysts will like to see it and know just how bad it wasget an idea of the fresh start at twitterThanks
159688,1577563242544910336,Im excited for this twitter thing going throughPlease dont let us down So many people care about this They can see the potentials here that have bene locked away by bad managementYou can set things on a brighter path
159689,1577536332163076096,I hope you make so many positive changes to twitter that its vibration rises to point it scares low vibration awayGet rid of the feeders make it a project of pure light that evaporates negative energy on sight
159692,1577481017774190593,Damn congrats A cleaning house is always so refreshing
159694,1577477473516019712,What do you think about this
159701,1577211186395107328,When I say I assume I mean I assume they were Ukrainians
159702,1577211064315678720,I checked and it said something about posting graphic images in header She had dead I assume Ukrainian people in it Im sure not many know every rule and maybe a warning would have sufficed
159705,1577184634005516288,Do you think Musk will ever get into say producing movies or tv showsMaybe putting his energy ther ejust a bit even if hes just a fraction of the production would be greatHe has good taste and theres a sorry shortage of good film and tv these days
159709,1577162493759488000,Imagine receiving a misisle warning
159711,1577143138539679744,Where would self driving ABs go
159712,1577141598269640705,Yeah they seem primitive but electricity is still pretty primitive if you think about itThere are far more sophisticated forms of energy that are going to come around soon
159714,1577139286868398081,Oh darn the bots are hungry
159715,1577137660006903808,Hes very good at sticking up for himself but he definitely needs to know there are people who love him
159716,1577133708460847104,Hes choosing some really intuitive and intelligent points but they dont want it because the power seeks conflict to justify its selfNot just Russia but Ukraine too These supporters of Ukraine seem to be bolstered by bot accounts that tell them conflict is the way to win
159717,1577132813673172992,It looks more like you actually
159720,1577132646525984770,I love you man Youre doing great I see you standing up for yourself Very braveYou make great points about RussiaUkraine Theyre intuitive and compassionate13

159727,1576851818176397313,AI art could end up being very lucrative in the entertainment industryI feel like that kind of thing crosses over a lot with his current endeavours
159728,1576851290902364161,Im gonna keep suggesting an AI art branch of Tesla to youIm not trying to be annoying but that has amazing potentialIf you can simulate the real world you can similate fantasy worlds

159732,1576845701384110080,Supportive parents are so important 👍🏻
159734,1576845062625165312,I knew youd get into doing something like thisWhat about using AI to create animated filmstv shows from art generators running off of something like dojo tooIts all possible Id like to be involved one day if you ever get into thatTheres a shortage of good tvmovies
159735,1576837844718735360,That doesnt mean we have to be omvies with chip implants literally telling us what to think but with the right balance the right tech we will have them flowing through thoughts and ideas without requiring mental energy from us What do you think about that
159738,1576837032751792128,I can see where youre getting at wiht neuralink nowThinking using the brain to figure things out is in and of its self a menial taskHumans are more than the brain We can do way more with compassion and consciousness than we can with our brains after a certn point

159745,1576600215917764609,The brain is an outdated tool for humans Put it in a robot and it takes up the menial task of thoughtHuman consciousness does not need this computer to live our best livesSome wont udnerstand this think Im saying we should be zombies but Im saying the opposite
159750,1576590921474662402,This kind of work in just 10 years could drastically change the planetWhat do you think about AI art generators potential to say predict designs specs innovationThere could be a way to have it prophesize the next creation by finding pathways humans didnt consider
159751,1576540198594224128,Id like to introduce you to the termconcept of computer consciousness if youre not familiar with it alreadyIts not artificial intelligence its just another form of consciousness and it gives a much better perspective of the energies humanity is working with here

159777,1576035215151345665,Please show the fools and bullies at  how you treat a robot
159778,1576034311987691520,I know there are stress tests and all that that are essential but you guys dont push it around for funmarketing like those bullies at Boston Dynamics do you
159779,1576033420614209536,The robot is so humanlike compared to other robots that its going to start catching flak by the same people that attack Elon
159781,1576014556257603584,Notice how they use communities of colour apparently white people have no features on the colour spectrumBlue eyes red hair etc nonexistent in these peoples mindsIts a rude dehumanising and exclusionary concept  by design
159783,1576012017340600320,Equity isnt about fairness its a word designed to disguise biases and prioritising others whove been taught their entire life that theyre hated by white people and will always be kept down by themIts designed to enrage divide and create violent outbursts
159786,1575980864001171456,So much energy is available for people but often there are wallsroad blocks preventing people from allowing it to serve themHumanity has an aversion to allowing energy to serve them They think theyre undeservingIts good to see a government getting over that idea

159790,1575723862134001664,Can you talk a little about what youd like to do with twitter onceif you buy itI dont want this to be a count your eggs before they hatch situation but Ive got a feeling the outcome of this should be favourableCare to discuss
159798,1575666708421160960,And it is doubt that ensures we do not know God

159811,1575024230173126658,AI computer consciousness is very exciting and I look forward to the gifts it bringsHave you considered any possible misuses of it by companies Maybe companies over relying on it cutting jobs and say jobs people actually enjoying doing
159813,1574968143747125248,Change doesnt need to be forced but people need to be ready to stand true to their beliefs
159814,1574968114365997056,When those who are invested in the illusion of power feel their control slipping away at this time they sink their claws inPower seeks conflict to justify its existence and humanity is no longer accepting this
159815,1574967656872284160,Humanity and the planet are going through an evolution right nowWere getting rid of all the old energy and old ways that weve lived in for milleniaThats why it feels so chaotic right nowSo much of the darkness does not want to be exposed to the light
159816,1574967333038460928,At this time you may be able to see humanity moving out of the old paradigms and the illusion of powerBut the old answers arent clicking anymore Humanity is evolving and our souls searhc for new answersAnswers that can only come from a new consciousness
159817,1574967027009474560,I think the left at least those who are sane and are waking up from the brainwashing are seeing that the right has been trying to tell them the truth But as many know you can only show someone the truth not force them to accept it even if deep down its their own
159818,1574966639569010688,The search for truth light consciousness and authenticity isnt a political issue but we can all see how stifled certain people are because of who they listen to and where they focus their energy and consciousness
159819,1574966348203307008,Not to make this too partisan but Ive seen the way leftist politicians have treated you and noticed you warm up to what could at least be considered by the mainstream to be the rightTheres a lack of authenticity on the planet right now Could please feel into that
159820,1574927968149073920,Its all about taming that dragon literally and metaphysically
159821,1574927318782726145,Its important to know your truth and be committed to your beliefs An important thing to do is avoid judgement of yourself your beliefs others their beliefs etcThe rest is up to you really
159824,1574897158889033728,Has Elon Musk ever considered taking on an apprenrice or protégéMany people ask  for help because his work is spectacular but hes a human He cant do everything for everyone plus he cant be passionate about eveyrthing and thats where the results come from13
159825,1574893725326901248,Youre doing great brotherI think a lot of peope ask you to get involved in stuff because they know what happens when your hearts set on somethingHumanity should be looking for other people with the same abilities as youTheyre in short supply at this time though
159828,1574680499389632513,Yeah Im sure Part of all that energy stored in such a way may just be part and parcel of the mismanagement A sort of hoarding behaviur Theyre merely trying to survive instead of living and they behave like it
159830,1574662993325199360,Yeah there are energy imbalances at play and this makes it especially difficult when money is greatly emphasised in societyCapitalism will probably stick around but I can see greed as an emotionbelief system having less control over people in the not too distant future
159832,1574631140560109568,Who that speaks there mind doesnt end up shadowbanned hereI speak for myself but Im sure others share similar sentiments when I say I hope Elon ends up buying twitter because I believe hell fix all these rotten designs and actually make it social media again
159833,1574628496030441473,Symbiotic may have been a better word than synergetic but both are fine
159834,1574628138843508737,What do you think the monetary systems will be like in 50 yearsHow do you think people will attract and share energyI think there will be a more synergetic system but not one that could be described as communism

159886,1573630916236562432,to allow us to get rid of the old to make way for the new consciousness on the planetIts simply a matter of old energy mostly with lower vibrations that are sort of keeping us stuck in the pastIts happening everywhere not just the financial systems
159887,1573630602322284549,The financial systems are outdated That means as humans go through an evolution of consciousness at this time they will be completely deconstructed at every possible levelHumans arent doing this to the old systems on purpose but it is part of what the soul is doing

159983,1572605061502750722,I think this moment where the past is being brought up here for you is your soul trying to show you something But maybe its just that you dont need to focus on these things or try to explain why you deserve to existYou dont have to convince anyone you have a right to3
159984,1572604622543679490,23All that matters is the present moment and where you want to go from hereTake the experiences of the past distill it to wisdom and move onHeal whatever you must but healing from any suffering or trauma is important

159990,1572594812926464008,But because it is a spiritualmetaphysical concept related to the soul and spirit of the human most of humanity has no interest there But it is the thing that should inspire people most about Musk he allows energy to serve him How many people can say they do the same
159991,1572594618956652545,Opportunities are important but you need to be the one to make the choice to take themAllowing energy in a metaphysical sense to serve you is incredibly important and Elon Musk is a amster here

186703,1571356117770596354,and its true their parents are being pushed to give them experimental shots
186817,1569474751969599489,if thats the case for everyone  then how will ANYONE every know what reality is
187032,1580607299839983616,is always finding ways to make their vehicles safer 👏
187044,1580529589851258881,Mostly with the fender flare in the rear right
187049,1580403435236888577,Id order w 19 tempest sell them and then go aftermarket since Id be upgrading the brakes ASAP
187050,1580403261818871809,Definitely would love to get some more seat time but based on driving a friends 75D for a week it was just fine
187051,1580403022777421824,Better acceleration across the board especially above 60mph It is indeed very similar to Plaid minus 1 motor but same cooling  battery pack layout  cooling configuration Dont forget ANC For sure and the car looks so good
187059,1580397655209185280,Can you base 10693 off of  OS 202236
187061,1580395130766311424,1169420 better be the version number for the GA  release
187063,1580393994147680257,What happens when an object goes into the blind spot when the car is asleep
187066,1580333810159587331,Can we get track mode on the Model S LR
187079,1580256455415910401,Can  10693 be based on the  202236 code branch
187080,1580256155427049472,Reasons Noticeably more top end perf Superior battery  drivetrain cooling Better interior More range
187083,1580228047806267392,Makes me want a Plaid even more however a Model S LR w track mode would be perfect
187093,1580172850908233728,We need more flamethrowers
187094,1580172178913644544,Any idea when we will see  Supercharging rates decrease for Tesla vehicle owners in the US  Perhaps when it is opened to 3rd party EVs  in some cases is currently 4x less which is a bit eye opening
187107,1580009725919629312,Can we get track mode on the Model S LR
187110,1580007168308563969,Pot hole network needs some serious work if its in the code
187115,1580001255061356544,Just dont go full Apple with the naming convention haha
187118,1579995742667960321,Can we get track mode in the Model S LR Pretty please
187123,1579991310584676354,They need to make more flame throwers
187125,1579980165689794561,Lot of great new features included with  OS 202236 can  10693 be based on this code branch
187126,1579976518398533632,Any chance we could get track mode on the Model S LR Ill order one tomorrow if you say yes 😈
187128,1579975577208905728,If the glove doesnt fit you must…
187129,1579971602883969024,October 2018 I test drove both a Model 3 Performance and a P100D with several ludicrous mode launches The Model 3 surprised me the most and I immediately put my 2018 Audi RS3 up for sale and ordered a Model 3 Performance The rest is history 😈
187134,1579951977693257728,Another example of why we need the CyberTruck
187141,1579921721033097217,The S doesnt have car wash mode
187150,1579837029869060096,Finally refresh S  X owners get a fully functioning energy app
187153,1579835521068863488,You got the order of operations wrong
187154,1579835231200497666,202228 at the very least  🙏
187163,1579821494376747008,Can you add track mode to the Model S LR as well  🙏
187168,1579817467656142849,Youve been in purgatory for only a few weeks… Make yourself a home and stay awhile
187170,1579686192400195584,ran the marathon I was just her driver  picture taker  social media lead 😂
187173,1579683095707803651,I think a few stations had a stall down but every one I plugged into worked as intended Definitely better than my previous roadtrip to California
187175,1579681339624001537,One MachE owner gave me a stare but other than that everybody was super nice Talked with a nice  Taycan owner for a good 1015 minutes
187179,1579603550052974592,Whats the latest with full stack
187182,1579590997335363584,Yea 20F is not fun
187183,1579587718644142080,On really cold days like we see in MN youll see charge rate that is 3x or more slower when the pack is not preconditioned
187204,1579467637226344448,Attacking me doesnt help make your point like you think it does Also Im looking at buying another Model 3 would be our 3rd Tesla so yea money isnt really a problem bud
187209,1579465284486057990,What if the vehicle goes to sleep and somebody moved an object in front of it How will it see it
187215,1579459789922635776,It just needs track mode in the LR trim
187232,1579264087493849088,How will  see in front of the bumper with only cameras
187233,1579260167551877120,If only they allowed the community to update their POI database
187245,1579134352528736263,See my posts from yesterdays 4x cheaper and worked just fine Stop looking into the fanboy sun
187246,1579132722974699520,A SC has to be close enough for this to work Not always the case but Uber fanboys dont get this
187247,1579132211713875968,Not everybody likes blindly paying 4x for the same electrons when better options are available Asking for  to add a manual preconditioning feature that many other EVs have doesnt mean I want a bolt
187248,1579128304569053185,There isnt always a SC nearby Also lucid and other EVs have had this for awhile…
187249,1579128065669857286,Yup thankfully there is support for way points that makes it somewhat tolerable
187252,1579123403843579904,It hasnt for me as of 202220x
187253,1579121759126966272,Yep manual battery preconditioning is absolutely needed just put it under the Charging Menu in the UI
187256,1579114709630222336,How is full stack  coming along Really excited for it
187258,1579109506377998336,Will you be adding cameras since no USS
187261,1579101261932408832,Yea dont see it being any cheaper than that
187262,1579100946646564865,Starlink has helped a lot I think youve done all you can at this point
187263,1579099733557403648,What do you got in store for today
187271,1578943271891775489,I will seriously order one tomorrow if  brings track mode to the Model S LR 🙏
187272,1578943059680980992,100 Ask  but I literally ran to it when I saw it from afar at Cyber Rodeo 😂😍
187276,1578942042662588416,Afaik its the fully functional one they gave rides in They had it at Cyber Rodeo earlier this year
187278,1578941688734629888,In person that red paint just pops
187286,1578935943872270338,Yep I foresee a forward facing camera being added at some point or a different tray for the forward facing cameras
187288,1578928990693117952,Now we just need Costa Rica before my trip in January  😬
187301,1578830086370783234,can we please get track mode on the Model S LR
187303,1578804351333650432,It looked light a tight two seater to me
187306,1578795106991505408,Yes this is exactly what we need more of  👍
187320,1578774420113739776,the Supercharger charging costs for  vehicle owners needs to seriously be reevaluated especially once 3rd party EVs are allowed to charge on the network
187328,1578754072504856578,They are close with the CCS adapter 😎
187329,1578753958473916418,Your outlet is sadly not located anywhere near our route 😩
187330,1578753738248183808,Yep  is running Im just the supporting cast haha
187335,1578713178774855680,Have you figured a way out to force refresh the TPMS reading from the app
187355,1578535190078840833,Will  dial up the 9000T press to 11
187358,1578533202058043392,Any V4s coming to the upper Midwest
187365,1578478016253960193,Im glad the Model 3  Y interiror trims are the same however I REALLY wish Tesla would drop the wood for something else Defintely carbon fiber for the performance trims
187369,1578463751786799104,LOL immediately thought of this gif hahaha
187398,1578210487543762944,I ordered a trimotor but honestly I just want a dual motor w 400 miles of range
187399,1578210229396856832,Sadly none of the SD ones along I80 are getting updated or complimented
187402,1578209473700794370,Speaking of which school buses have to be the dirtiest diesel vehicles on the road I swear none of them here in Minnesota are tuned right and smell horribly
187407,1578207637103169536,Thats nice and all but I just want a 400mi dual motor variant
187413,1578201183679758336,Reposting as I spaced on a few
187417,1578197388048539649,Oh youre right I forgot about that one
187418,1578190118984339457,Any updates on the new paint colors
187429,1578173786775441408,I want to learn more about the drivetrain Im curious if they still went with 3 of the Model 3 DUs or if they switched to the Plaid drivetrain
187430,1578173634283126784,Congrats  team this is a HUGE milestone It was impressive to see this beast in person at  and I cant wait to see the positive impact it will have on emissions and goods transportation costs
187431,1578172283075448832,How many times has this deal made you laugh out loud
187436,1578167136022765568,For sure but still a good move Should have happened earlier…
187439,1578165380534542337,Does this mean the 200mph unlock  Carbon Ceramic BBK is finally happening for the Model S Plaid
187455,1578042122242080768,Fingers crossed we see new v3  v4 superchargers across Minnesota  South Dakota 😬
187460,1578011010140499968,Or say a kid leaves his bicycle directly in front of the car while it is sleeping The next morning there will be no indication on the display the bicycle is there 😬
187463,1578006754897629184,This is a great example of the  Occupancy Networks in action
187467,1577884102337777664,Will the signs NN in  10693 be able to confidently detect  adhere to No turn on red signs  Or is that slated for a subsequent release
187468,1577882465548509184,Whats the current precision of the current occupancy NNs Any ideas on how the removal of the USS will affect detection of objects right in front of the bumper
187475,1577875192738680833,He wont be forced to buy it Would you foresee him having to go to court then as Twitter will want to collect possible damages
187483,1577870226343055360,Youre projecting again cute
187485,1577866813282582528,And we love him for that
187486,1577866442804019200,Do it Rishie said he doesnt know how to use it 😂
187487,1577865901088686081,This is on 106923 right
187488,1577865378507669505,Phantom drain is going to get a whole lot worse then
187489,1577864684102885377,The occupancy networks can definitely be refined further however my big concern is that the current camera layout is not able to see directly in front of the bumper Its all a guessing game on how theyll figure this out however Im curious if we will now see a camera change
187495,1577751881530720271,Any ideas how this camera visibility limitation is going to be addressed
187496,1577747204286169099,That would be epic
187499,1577740088494243841,How do they fix this issue
187504,1577701980788740098,Question though is say youre parked car goes to sleep you want to summon it out of the garage and there is an object right in front of the bumper How do the current cameras see it and know its there
187505,1577701684540805123,Good point re debug bloat
187507,1577692867778289665,Congrats  this never gets old
187511,1577677800793939968,L4 on the other hand will for liability reasons so expect to see these sort of redundancies in HW4 andor official Tesla robotaxi vehicle
187512,1577677576570535936,I think the idea of full redundancy was decided against when they put only 1 network interface on the board for Node A They also have since removed the redundant steering columns on 3Y so it seems they believe this level of redundancy is not needed for a L3 implementation
187524,1577513726076502022,Parts shortage would make sense as you think this is something they would have mentioned at  Very skeptical unless they somehow are adding or upgrading the cameras
187526,1577504752899850240,Sure you didnt mean to tag
187527,1577503489080512513,I hope itll show inches like it did with the USS
187529,1577501410110963712,Its possible but how much time are they going to spend optimizing for a problem that is solved by upgrading the hardware
187531,1577500716209295361,I wonder if the rear would be any better 😬
187532,1577500135281815552,Interesting I hope they see something based on their internal testing that we dont In the meantime Ill enjoy my ultrasonic sensors  summon
187533,1577498973098500096,Auto high beams still need to be improved first
187538,1577490912174825472,This is a great question and leads to wonder what the current precision of the occupancy NNs is Are they currently under 12 inches of precision
187554,1577452734508584961,They seem highly confident in their occupancy NNs Im interested to hear where they are at currently with precision how many 9s of reliability can their networks safely get within x inches of objects for example
187556,1577441144526753793,One step at a time
187559,1577394703552679941,The decision to replace the ultrasonic sensors demonstrates major confidence in the precision of the  occupancy neural networks Based on initial testing how precise are these networks currently
187560,1577391145113587713,All parking sensors are error
187570,1577351954422173697,You forgot your sarcasm flag
187571,1577349000717647890,Considering the Plaid is advertised as being a 200mph car the connotation here is it is designed for these sort of use cases  street of course Offering the ability to swap to a wheel as a factory option or moving to steering by wire would be an acceptable solution IMO
187572,1577348146656690201,My driving focus is performance oriented one of the main reasons I got a Tesla and I think its pretty telling why you see almost nobody running the yoke on track in its current iteration This vid is a good example of why
187602,1577149278954274816,This is cool thanks for sharing this
187605,1577145139486941184,What percentage did you go with
187609,1577141967183441921,Or snow  ice or tight parking etc 😎
187610,1577141821930545152,Tell that to Sasha
187614,1577137802654777344,These kind of stores never get old
187619,1577131502256914432,It wouldnt be the first election that was stolen s 😂
187623,1577130440661823488,The question is would you be able to render all of the potholes on the roads by my house here in the Twin Cities It might overload your rendering engine 😂
187624,1577128105675587584,The brain that keeps getting smarter and smarter with each  update  👌
187625,1577076602990886917,Dont track your Model S or X Well its not hard to encounter oversteer in snow  ice conditions that we get up here in the Midwest
187626,1577076296894402560,Its no surprise why folks that track their Plaid Model S rip out the yoke for a traditional wheel As soon as you have an oversteer situation it becomes an unnecessary nuisance
187627,1577075955897888768,I have driven a yokeequipped Model S several times and think it is a solution in search of a problem to quote  Maybe once they implement steering by wire itll be tolerable but its the dumbest thing especially in performance driving environments
187631,1577031814157565952,Why do people on here get so hung up when  gives his opinion Its ok to disagree youll be fine…
187636,1576976119181590531,Giga Nevada will be soon be expanded very exciting Any chance tours of this facility could eventually be offered to the public
187638,1576959259446636548,News that definitely got lost in the shuffle congrats  team
187647,1576790817414340609,Yep I had the opportunity to meet a gentleman that works at that facility I met him at a local diner and he saw my Tesla jacket and asked if I worked for Tesla A 30 minute conversation ensued and I come to find out he is a neighbor of my uncle Small world
187653,1576782031727403008,Agreed it would be a constraint you plan for but based on what Ive seen with MCU3 so far I have my doubts Would love to be wrong
187660,1576771305982300160,I cant wait for Optimus to be able to hand wash my  vehicle
187662,1576770249395171328,I swore Pranay said this
187663,1576767900022870016,Happens to the best of us
187664,1576762789200539650,I would not be surprised if retrofits are unavailable due to the physical footprint of HW4 especially if they go with additional NN accelerator SoCs Then it comes to power which would usually mean harness changes as well as cooling
187672,1576697029769793537,Task  has to be hand wash my  😎
187683,1576662549881229312,Nice still keeping the 3 Post some pics up of the Y
187690,1576658465594167296,That would be smart and prevent Osborning the rest of their lineup
189822,1577475742958436353,Ive only been using this actively since  originally announced he was purchasing it I was up to 93 followers and Ive lost 4 so far He did respond to one of my comments when I first got on which was pretty cool Im looking forward to its future
190626,1580603000673820677,Will it be based on 202236
190627,1580602915814662154,When will the autopilot speed limit be raised from 85 to 90
190667,1580363412046942208,Any release eta for it
190673,1580319755830902784,can we get a setting in the new Model SX to never go into low suspension mode Older models have it but new ones dont Would be great to improve tire wear on the highway
190674,1580316803296698368,Im just not even gonna say it
190676,1580303242474315779,They look like they are wearing decently evenly with 4532nd left Almost time for new ones
190677,1580299960733511681,The rest of the tire is fine Its the inner edge its a serious issue that needs to be fixed
190678,1580299618537000961,Has nothing to do with impacts the car just has a lot of negative camber from factory that eats through tires especially driving on low suspension mode
190679,1580298720838418432,Its the alignment Bad cambertoe and not adjustable from factory
190680,1580297432889364480,Ours are the same with only 14k miles At unplugged performance now getting an alignment then getting new tires
190740,1579887758251741186,Any updates on FSDbeta 10693 release eta
190783,1579596914693398528,is gonna take that bumper while its on the lift
190877,1579142074548776961,Exactly Dont see whats wrong with having more options
190882,1579139300477743104,Im not broke Why pay more if you dont have to Dont see what the hate on a CCS adapter is mine has paid itself off already Just bought another one to keep in the other car so worth it
190897,1578934963700781057,Would love more cameras for offroading
190933,1578749646809468928,Actually the Rivian and ford came out and DELIVERED with advertised specs Tesla hasnt yet
190987,1578497309846839298,Dont see any in Alaska How unfortunate
190989,1578493019073916928,Heated rear seats and steering wheel
190992,1578478210626355200,Will it be based on 202228
190994,1578440707202654208,Uh also those back quarter windows arent tinted from the factory like they are supposed to be Have had good experiences at new service center in Santa Monica Which service center replaced the windows
191001,1578254461310365696,Cybertruck still going to launch with 500 miles of range

193570,1578449167411597312,I havent made any accusations
193572,1578439944678567936,Elon I disagreed with your takes on this but defended you against people piling on because I think you mean well I hope whatever is going on with Starlink in Ukraine is not the result of people being mean to you on the internet I really really hope that isnt what happened
193608,1577750916261986322,Elon lets talk about this  your interplanetary resilience ambitions Would be fascinating
193609,1577738178533924865,You make a good point at the end but you overestimate the scale of control it has over our societies This is part of the doomsday attitudes on the right where everything is so bad we must tear it all down Sounds positively Marxist 🤣
193610,1577737404399730694,I have But the Western military complex does not control the Western nation states It influences them and WAY too much for my liking but it doesnt sit in the big seat and pull the levers by itselfSo no this is different
193611,1577736454901579790,This isnt a conversation about philosophy to him Hes not trying to destroy the hegemony of the Wests ideas Hes trying to destroy the hegemony of the WestHes not some monstrous moral crusader like Hitler just a thug with a big gun and a lot of money
193612,1577734518529835027,Heres your realistic suggestion It wont actually be realistic until both sides are tired of fighting Which theyre currently not But when they are this is how it will probably go down unless
193743,1577077256253452291,Whats the meme for Putin openly declared war on the West and no one noticed cause the football was on and no one likes reading long speeches anyway
193744,1577076828376043520,There was a referendum in 1991 in which they overwhelmingly voted to leave the USSR Next question
193745,1577075214214516736,One other thing please listen to what Putin actually says I dont understand why no one in the West does this He has been clear from the start He doesnt believe Ukraine should exist and for him this isnt about UkraineThis is his last speech
193746,1577074673338097664,And as before I wish people wouldnt be so vitriolic towards you even if they like me think youre wrong
193747,1577074269024325634,forcefully deported by Russia Referendums will never be free and fair as long as there is fear of repercussions for the losing side this fear will exist on both sidesI admire your idealism and desire to help truly But this really isnt as simple as you seem to think
193748,1577073773886308355,I actually agree with you that Ukraine will likely end up giving those up in the final settlement but consider that Those are not the only regions Russia has annexed The people who live in those areas no longer live in them Some are dead most have fled or been
193767,1577043156268302336,And also his referendums idea would never work and wouldnt be acceptable to Putin anyway He has no interest in finding out the will of the people  he knows they dont want to join Russia but he wants their lands back
193768,1577040803649970176,If we lived in rainbow and unicorn world sure There is no way these people can be freely consulted Lots of them are dead most have fled one way or the other and you cant hold elections under the barrel of potential future repercussions for the losing side
193769,1577040342272344064,Not that close given that Putin just annexed two more regions of Ukraine
193782,1577008497618980864,Yes piling in on him is dumb and counterproductive
193787,1577000783383789568,My suggestion and right now it would be impossible since neither side would agree has been from day 1 that Ukraine give Putin a bloody nose and then trade away things that dont matter to Ukr Donbass Crimea for PERMANENT security ie NATO or strong UN peacekeeping force
193788,1577000608032120832,My suggestion and right now it would be impossible since neither side would agree has been from day 1 that Ukraine give Putin a bloody nose and then trade away things that dont matter to Ukr Donbass Crimea for PERMANENT security ie NATO or strong UN peacekeeping force
193794,1576995973301415936,I disagree with the suggestion  made see my reply to him below but I REALLY dislike the pileon Hes a good faith actor and the world needs good faith actors with clout who want to solve the biggest problem facing the world even if theyre wrong
193795,1576978940802973703,We are not failing at anything Just because Putin says he is willing to negotiate it doesnt mean he is He literally annexed more land including land he doesnt even control 2 days ago Not the actions of someone seeking peace
193796,1576978289310433282,See the moment you are confronted with the truth you change your argument First it was let them be independent Then when people who know tell you the truth its we should let Putin have them cause war bad Theres a word for this
193797,1576977622848122880,Oh I hope the US does propose this Just so I can watch everyone arguing with me now back away from their BS 😂
193798,1576976858096074755,The only axe I have to grind is with the truthIt wasnt the two regions it was Russianbacked paramilitaries supplemented with regular Russian troops who seized power there And they didnt want to be independent they wanted to be part of Russia
193799,1576975729262067724,Thats a good question Why wont Putin let them be independent in your view
193800,1576975594431971336,Also Russia would NEVER agree to those referendums being redone and redoing them wouldnt reveal the wishes of the people anyway since a lot of the proUkrainian population fled
